<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE"></a>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Elias Hicks was a much misunderstood man in his own
time, and the lapse of eighty years since his death has done
but little to make him known to the passing generations.
His warm personal friends, and of them there were many,
considered him little less than a saint; his enemies, some
of whom were intensely bitter in their personal feeling,
whatever may have been the basis of their judgment,
believed him to be a man whose influence was malevolent
and mischievous. It is no part of the purpose of this book
to attempt to reconcile the conflicting estimates touching
the life and character of this remarkable man. On the
contrary, our hope is to present him as he was, in his own
environment, and not at all as he might have been had he
lived in our time, or as his admirers would have him, to
make him conform to their own estimate. In this biographical
task, Elias Hicks becomes largely his own interpreter.
As he measured himself in private correspondence and in
public utterance, so this book will endeavor to measure him.</p>

<p>We believe that it is not too much to say that he carried
the fundamental idea of the Society of Friends, as delivered
by George Fox, to its logical conclusion, as applied to
thought and life, more clearly and forcibly than any of his
predecessors or contemporaries. Not a few of those who
violently opposed him, discounted the position of Fox and
Barclay touching the Inner Light, and gave exaggerated
importance to the claims of evangelical theology. Whatever
others may have thought, Elias Hicks believed that he
preached Christianity of the pure apostolic type, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
Quakerism as it was delivered by the founders. It should
be remembered that the conformist and non-conformist
disputants of the seventeenth century talked as savagely
about Fox as the early nineteenth century critics did about
Hicks. In fact, to accept the theory of Fox about the
nature and office of the indwelling spirit, necessarily
develops either indifference or opposition to the plans and
theories of what was in the time of Elias Hicks, if it is not
now, the popularly accepted theology.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made to write a comprehensive
and detailed history of the so-called "separation." So far,
however, as the trouble related to Elias Hicks, it has been
considered, and as much light as possible has been thrown
on the case. Necessarily this does not admit of very much
reference to the setting up of separate meetings, which followed
the open rupture of 1827-28, or the contests over
property which occurred after the death of Elias Hicks.
Even the causes of the trouble in the Society only appear
as they seem necessary to make plain the feeling of Elias
Hicks in the case, and the attitude of his opponents toward
him.</p>

<p>In dealing with the doctrines of Elias Hicks, or his
views about various subjects, we have endeavored to avoid
the one-sided policy, and to discriminate between the matters
which would be accepted by the majority of those
Friends to-day who are erroneously made to bear the name
of Elias Hicks, and the theories which they now repudiate.
On the other hand, his most conservative and peculiar ideas
are given equal prominence with those which more nearly
conform to present-day thought.</p>

<p>In stating cases of antagonism, especially where it
appeared in public meetings, we have endeavored rather to
give samples, than to repeat and amplify occurrences where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
the same purpose and spirit were exhibited. The citations
in the book should, therefore, be taken as types, and not as
mere isolated or extraordinary occurrences.</p>

<p>References to the descendants of Elias Hicks, and
other matters relating to his life, which do not seem to
naturally belong in the coherent and detailed story, will be
found in the appendix. This is also true of the usual
acknowledgment of assistance, and the reference to the published
sources of information consulted by the author in
writing the book.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Now and again a human life is lived in such obedience
to the "heavenly vision" that it becomes an authority in
other lives. The unswerving rectitude; whence is its divine
directness? the world has to ask. Its clear-sightedness;
how comes it that the eye is single to the true course? Its
strength to endure; from what fountain flows unfailing
strength? Its quickening sympathy; what is the sweet
secret?</p>

<p>The thought of the world fixes itself into stereotyped
and imprisoning forms from which only the white heat of
the impassioned seer and prophet can slowly liberate it.
At last the world ceases to persecute or to crucify its
liberator, and lo! an acknowledged revelation of God!
This came to pass in the seventeenth century, when it was
given George Fox to see and to proclaim that "there was
an anointing within man to teach him, and that the Lord
would teach him, himself."</p>

<p>The eighteenth century developed another teacher in
the religious society of Friends, whose message has been a
distinctly leavening influence in the thought of the world.
It is not easy to account for Elias Hicks. He was not the
"son of a prophet." Nor was he a gift from the <i>schools</i>
of the time in which he lived. In the "Journal of His Life
and Religious Labours," published in 1832 by Isaac T.
Hopper, there is no reference to school days.</p>

<p>There is one clue to this man that may explain much
to us. Of his ancestry he says in the restrained language
characteristic of his writings, "My parents were descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
from reputable families, and sustained a good character
among their friends and those who knew them." Here,
then, is the rock-foundation upon which he builded, the
factor which could not be spared from the life which he
lived&mdash;that in his veins was the blood of those who had
"sustained a good character among those who knew them."
Some of the leisure of his youth had been given to fishing
and fowling, which he looked back to as wholesome recreation,
since he mostly preferred going alone. While he
waited in stillness for the coming of the fowl, 'his mind was
at times so taken up in divine meditations, that the opportunities
were seasons of instruction and comfort to him.'
Out of these meditations grew the conviction in his tendered
soul that it was wanton diversion for himself and his
companions to destroy the small birds that could be of no
use to them.</p>

<p>Recalling his youth, he writes: "Some of my leisure
hours were occupied in reading the Scriptures, in which I
took considerable delight, and it tended to my real profit
and religious improvement." It may be that this great
classic in English, as well as library of ancient history, and
book of spiritual revelation, was not only the food that
stimulated his spiritual growth, but also took the place to
him, in some measure, of the schools as a means of culture.
It is plain to see that he had what is the first requisite for
a student&mdash;a hungering mind. The alphabet opened to him
the ways and means, which he used as far as he could, for
the satisfying of this divine hunger. A new book possessed
for him such charm, it is said, that his friends who
invited him for a social visit, knowing this, were careful to
put the new books out of sight, lest he should become
absorbed in them, and they lose his ever-welcome and very
entertaining conversation. He even had experience as a
teacher; and the testimony is given by an aged Friend, once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
his pupil: "The manners of Elias Hicks were so mild, his
deportment so dignified, and his conversation so instructive,
that it left an impression for good on many of his pupils'
minds that time never effaced."</p>

<p>That he had not the teaching of the schools narrowed
his own resources, and, doubtless, restricted his field of
vision. But such a life as his, that garnered wisdom more
than knowledge of books, is a great encouragement to those
who have not had the opportunities of the schools. We
might not know without being told that he had missed from
his equipment a college degree; but we do know that his
endowment of sound mind was supplemented with incorruptible
character; we do know that his life was founded
upon belief in everlasting truth and an unchanging integrity.
The record of his unfolding spiritual life shows that</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"So nigh is grandeur to our dust,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">So near is God to man,</div>
<div class="verse">When Duty whispers low, 'Thou must,'</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The youth replies, 'I can.'"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is evidence that Elias Hicks had not only a
hungering mind, but that he had in marked degree the open
mind, and that he accorded to others liberty of opinion.
It is said that he was unwilling that his discourses be
printed, lest they become a bondage to other minds. He
wrote to his friend, William Poole: "Therefore every generation
must have more light than the preceding one; otherwise,
they must sit down in ease in the labour and works of
their predecessors." And he left a word of caution to
approaching age, when he said in a meeting in New York:
"The old folks think they have got far enough, they are
settling on the lees, they are blocking up the way." It does
not disturb my thought of him that my own mother remembered
a mild rebuke from him for the modest flower-bed
that brightened the door-yard of her country home. For I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
discover in him rudiments of the love for beauty. A minister
among Friends was once his guest during the harvest
season on Long Island, and recalled long after that, when
the hour arrived for the mid-week meeting, he came in from
the harvest field, and not only exchanged his working for
his meeting garments, but added his gloves, although it
was hot, midsummer weather. There was certainly the rudimentary
love for beauty in this scrupulous regard for the
proprieties; but it was kept in such severe check that he
could not justify the spending of time upon a flower-border.
The poet had not then expressed for us the sweet garden
prayer that might have brought to his sensitive mind a new
view of the purpose and value of the flower-border:</p>

<p>From the days in which he preferred his hours of
solitude in fishing as opportunities for "divine meditations"
we can trace his steady spiritual growth. While his business
life was henceforth subordinated to his labors among
men to promote the life of the spirit, he was never indifferent
to the exact discharge of his own financial obligations;
nor was he indifferent to the needs of others. One
incident surely marks him as belonging to the School of
Christ: "Once when harvests were light and provisions
scarce and high, his own wheat fields yielded abundantly.
Foreseeing the scarcity and consequent rise in prices, speculators
sought early to buy his wheat. He declined to sell.
They offered him large prices, and renewed their visits
repeatedly, increasing the price each time. Still he refused
to sell, even for the unprecedented sum of three dollars a
bushel. But by and by, when his poorer neighbors, whose
crops were light, began to need, he invited them to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
and get as much wheat as they required for use, at the
usual price of one dollar a bushel."</p>

<p>He entered into the life of his community and of his
times, anticipating by nearly a century the work of Friends'
Philanthropic Committees of the present day. It is related
that he was much opposed to an attempt to establish a
liquor-selling tavern in the Jericho neighborhood&mdash;that
when he saw strangers approaching he would invite them
to accept his own hospitality, thus making unnecessary the
tavern-keeping business in the sparsely settled country
town.</p>

<p>We would expect that, with his sense of justice and
his appreciation of values, Elias Hicks would place men and
women side by side, not only in the home, but also in the
larger household of faith, and in the affairs of the world.
It is remembered that his face was set in this direction&mdash;that,
strict Society-disciplinarian as he was, he advocated a
change in the Discipline to allow women a consulting voice
in making and amending the Discipline.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that he lived through the
Revolutionary period of 1776, and through the War of
1812. So true was he to his convictions against war that
he would not allow himself to benefit by the advanced
prices in foodstuffs; and we are told that the records of
his monthly meeting show that he sacrificed much of his
property by adherence to his peace principles.</p>

<p>Neither can we forget the testing that came to him in
the institution of slavery. For, according to the custom
of the times, his own father was the owner of slaves. His
open mind responded to the labors of a committee of the
New York Yearly Meeting; and upon the freeing of his
father's slaves, he ever after considered their welfare,
making such restitution as he could for past injustice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>To his daughter, Martha Hicks, he wrote: "My dear
love to thee, to thy dear mother, who next to the Divine
Blesser has been the joy of my youth, and who, I trust and
hope, will be the comfort of my declining years. O dear
child, cherish and help her, for she hath done abundance
for thee."</p>

<p>These fruits of the religious faith of Elias Hicks are
offered as the test given us by the Great Teacher himself,
by which to know the life of a man. They mark a life
rooted in the life of God. Imperishable as the root whence
they grew, may they feed the souls of men from generation
to generation, satisfying the hungry, strengthening the
weak, and making all glad in the joy of each! Thus it is
permitted to be "still praising Him."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Ancestry and Boyhood.</p>


<p>The Hicks family is English in its origin, authentic
history tracing it clearly back to the fourteenth century.
By a sort of genealogical paradox, a far-away ancestor of
the apostle of peace in the eighteenth century was a man
of war, for we are told that Sir Ellis Hicks was knighted
on the battlefield of Poitiers in 1356, nearly four hundred
years before the birth of his distinguished descendant on
Long Island, in America.</p>

<p>From the best available data, it is believed that the
progenitor of the Hicks family on Long Island arrived in
America in 1638, and came over from the New England
mainland about 1645, settling in the town of Hempstead.
A relative, Robert by name, came over with the body of
Pilgrims arriving in Massachusetts in 1621.</p>

<p>John Hicks, the pioneer, was undoubtedly a man of
affairs, with that strong character which qualifies men for
leadership. In the concerns of the new community he was
often drafted for important public service. In Seventh
month, 1647, it became necessary to reach a final settlement
with the Indians for land purchased from them by the
colonists the year before. The adjustment of this transaction
was committed to John Hicks by his neighbors.
When, in 1663, the English towns on the island and the
New York mainland created a council whose aim it was to
secure aid from the General Court at Hartford against the
Dutch, John Hicks was made a delegate from Long Island.
In 1665 Governor Nicoll, of New York, called a convention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
to be composed of two delegates from each town in Westchester
County and on Long Island, "to make additions
and alterations to existing laws." John Hicks was chosen
delegate from the town of Hempstead.</p>

<p>Thomas, the great grandfather of Elias, was in 1691
appointed the first judge of Queens County, by Governor
Andross, which office he held for a number of years, with
credit to himself and satisfaction to his constituents.</p>

<p>The town of Hempstead is on the north side of Long
Island, and borders on the Sound. There Elias Hicks, the
fifth in line of descent from the pioneer John, was born
on the 19th of Third month, 1748. He was the fourth
child of John and Martha Smith Hicks. Of the ancestry
of the mother of Elias little is known. There is no evidence
that the ancestors of Elias on either side were members
of the Society of Friends, still they seem to have had
much in common with Friends, and, at any rate, were willing
to assist the peculiar people when the heavy hand of
persecution fell upon them. In this connection we may
quote the words of Elias himself. He says: "My father
was a grandson of Thomas Hicks, of whom our worthy
friend Samuel Bownas<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> makes honorable mention in his
Journal, and by whom he was much comforted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
strengthened when imprisoned through the envy of George
Keith,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> at Jamaica, on Long Island."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Samuel Bownas was a minister among Friends, and was born
in Westmoreland, England, about 1667. He secured a minute to make
a religious visit to America the latter part of 1701. Ninth month 30,
1702, he was bound over to the Queens County Grand Jury, the charge
against him being that in a sermon he had spoken disparagingly of the
Church of England. The jury really failed to indict him, which greatly
exasperated the presiding judge, who threatened to deport him to
London chained to the man-of-war's deck. It was at this point that
Thomas Hicks, whom Bownas erroneously concluded was Chief
Justice of the Province, appeared to comfort and assure him that he
could not thus be deported to England. Bownas continued in jail for
about a year, during which time he learned the shoemaker's trade. He
was finally liberated by proclamation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> George Keith, born near Aberdeen, 1639, became connected with
the Society of Friends about 1662. He came to America in 1684,
but finally separated from Friends, and endeavored to organize a new
sect to be called Christian, or Baptist Quakers. This effort failed, and
about 1700 he entered the Church of England. After this he violently
criticised Friends, and repeatedly sought controversy with them. He
had quite an experience of this sort with Samuel Bownas, and was
considered the real instigator of the complaint on which Bownas was
lodged in jail. Keith looms up large in all that body of history and
biography unfriendly to the Society of Friends.</p></div>

<p>We are told in the Journal, "Neither of my parents
were members in strict fellowship with any religious society,
until some little time before my birth."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is certain that
the father of Elias was a member among Friends at the time
of his birth, and his mother must also have enjoyed such
membership. Elias must have been a birthright member,
as he nowhere mentions having been received into the
Society by convincement. It is evident that his older
brothers and sisters were not connected with Friends.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Journal of Elias Hicks, p. 7.</p></div>

<p>When Elias was eight years of age his father removed
from Hempstead to the south shore of Long Island, the
new home being near the seashore. Both before and after
that time he bewails the fact that his associates were not
Friends, and what he confessed was worse&mdash;they were
persons with no religious inclinations or connections whatever.</p>

<p>The new home afforded added opportunities for
pleasure. Game was plentiful in the wild fowl that mated
in the marshes and meadows, while the bays and inlets
abounded in fish. Hunting and fishing, therefore, became
his principal diversion. While he severely condemned this
form of amusement in later life, he brought to the whole
matter a rational philosophy. He considered that at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span>
time hunting and fishing were profitable to him, because in
his exposed condition "they had a tendency to keep me
more at and about home, and often prevented my joining
with loose company, which I had frequent opportunities of
doing without my father's knowledge."</p>

<p>Three years after moving to the new home, when Elias
was eleven years of age, his mother was removed by death.
The father, thus left with six children, two younger than
Elias, finally found it necessary to divide the family. Two
years after the death of his mother he went to reside with
one of his elder brothers who was married, and lived some
distance from his father's. It is probable that this brother's
house was his home most of the time until he was seventeen.
Much regret is expressed by him that he was thus removed
from parental restraint.</p>

<p>The Journal makes possibly unnecessarily sad confession
of what he considered waywardness during this period.
He says that he wandered far from "the salutary path of
true religion, learning to sing vain songs, and to take delight
in running horses."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Just what the songs were, and the
exact character of the horse racing must be mainly a matter
of conjecture. Manifestly "running horses" did not mean
at all the type of racetrack gambling with which twentieth-century
Long Island is familiar.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Journal of Elias Hicks, p. 8.</p></div>

<p>In the midst of self-accusation, he declares that he did
not "give way to anything which was commonly accounted
disreputable, having always a regard to strict honesty, and
to such a line of conduct as comported with politeness and
good breeding."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> One can scarcely think of Elias Hicks
as a juvenile Chesterfield. From the most unfavorable
things he says about himself, the conclusion is easily reached
that he was really a serious-minded youth, and what has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
always been considered a "good boy." It must be remembered,
however, that he set for himself a high standard,
which was often violated, as he became what he called
"hardened in vanity." Speaking of his youthful sports, and
possible waywardness, his maturer judgment confessed, that
but "for the providential care of my Heavenly Father, my
life would have fallen a sacrifice to my folly and indiscretion."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>There is practically no reference to the matter of
schools or schooling in the Journal. There is every reason
for the belief that he was self-educated. He may have
had a brief experience at schools of a rather primary
character. At all events he must have had a considerable
acquaintance with mathematics, and evidently he at an early
age contracted the reading habit. Books were few, and of
periodical literature there was none. Friendly literature
itself was confined to Sewell's History, probably Ellwood's
edition of George Fox's Journal, while he may have had
access to some of the controversial pamphlets of the seventeenth
century period. The Journals of various "ancient"
Friends were to be had, but how rich the mine of this literature
which he explored we shall never know. Evidently
from his youth he was a careful and intelligent reader of
the Bible, and regarding its passages, its ethics and its theology,
he became his own interpreter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">His Young Manhood.</p>


<p>At the age of seventeen Elias became an apprentice,
and set about learning the carpenter's trade. His mechanical
experience during this period receives practically no
attention in the Journal. We know, however, that in those
days none of the trades were divided into sectional parts as
now. In short, he learned a whole trade, and not part of
one. It was the day of hand-made doors, and not a few
carpenters took the timber standing in the forest, and superintended
or personally carried on all of the processes of
transforming it into lumber and from it producing the
finished product. The carpenter of a century and a half ago
had to be able to wield the broad-ax, and literally know
how to "hew to the line."</p>

<p>It is not known exactly how long this apprenticeship
lasted, but probably about four years. As a matter of
course, there was much moving from neighborhood to
neighborhood, as the building necessities demanded the
presence of the carpenters. The life was more or less
irregular, and Elias says that he received neither serious
advice nor restraint at the hands of his "master." He was
brought in contact with frivolously minded young people,
and was unduly carried away with the love of amusement.
During this period he learned to dance, and enjoyed the
experience. But he considered dancing a most mischievous
pastime, and evil to a marked degree. For this
indulgence he repeatedly upbraided himself in the Journal.
In his opinion, dancing was "an unnatural and unchristian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
practice," never receiving the approval "of the divine light
in the secret of the heart."</p>

<p>He passed through various experiences in the endeavor
to break away from the dancing habit, with many backslidings,
overthrowing what he considered his good resolutions.
But finally he separated from all those companions
of his youth who beset him with temptation. He says: "I
was deeply tried, but the Lord was graciously near; and as
my cry was secretly to him for strength, he enabled me to
covenant with him, that if he would be pleased in mercy to
empower me, I would forever cease from this vain and
sinful amusement."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Journal of Elias Hicks, p. 10.</p></div>

<p>His first intimation touching the eternally lost condition
of the wicked is in connection with his experience at
this time. We cannot do better than to quote his own
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In looking back to this season of deep probation, my
soul has been deeply humbled; for I had cause to believe
that if I had withstood at this time the merciful interposition
of divine love, and had rebelled against this clear
manifestation of the Lord's will, he would have withdrawn
his light from me, and my portion would have been among
the wicked, cast out forever from the favorable presence
of my judge. I should also forever have been obliged to
acknowledge his mercy and justice, and acquit the Lord,
my redeemer, who had done so much for me; for with long-suffering
and much abused mercy he had waited patiently
for my return, and would have gathered me before that
time, as I well knew, as a hen gathereth her chickens under
her wings, but I would not."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Journal, p. 11.</p></div>

<p>His second diversion, and probably practiced after he
had given up dancing, was hunting. While not considered
in itself reprehensible, when the sport led to wantonness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
and the taking of life of bird or beast simply for amusement,
it was vigorously condemned. He says that he was
finally "led to consider conduct like this to be a great breach
of trust, and an infringement of the divine prerogative."
"It therefore became a settled principle with me not to take
the life of any creature, unless it was really useful and
necessary when dead, or very noxious and hurtful when
living."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Journal, p. 13.</p></div>

<p>When the settled conviction came to him touching the
dance and the sportsman's practice, he was probably not out
of his teens. This conviction resulted in victory over the
propensity, probably before he reached his majority. The
whole experience was an early illustration of the strength
of will and purpose which was characteristic of this remarkable
man throughout his entire life.</p>

<p>Marriage is always a turning-point in a man's life. In
the case of Elias Hicks, it was so in a marked degree.
Having become adept in his trade, at the age of twenty-two,
he was married to Jemima Seaman. This important
event cannot be better stated than in the simple, quaint language
of the bridegroom himself. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My affection being drawn toward her in that relation,
I communicated my views to her, and received from her a
corresponding expression; and having the full unity and
concurrence of our parents and friends, we, after some time,
accomplished our marriage at a solemn meeting of Friends,
at Westbury, on the 2d of First month, 1771. On this
important occasion we felt the clear and consoling evidence
of divine truth, and it remained with us as a seal upon our
spirits, strengthening us mutually to bear, with becoming
fortitude, the vicissitudes and trials which fell to our lot,
and of which we had a large share while passing through
this probationary state."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Journal, p. 13.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span></p></div>

<p>The records of Westbury Monthly Meeting contain the
official evidence of this marriage, which was evidently conducted
strictly in accordance with discipline. From the
minutes of that meeting we extract the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At a monthly <span class="correction" title="Originally: meting">meeting</span> held in the meeting house, ye
29th day of ye Eleventh month, 1770.</p>

<p>"Elias Hicks son of John Hicks, of Rockaway, and
Jemima Seaman, daughter of Jonathan Seaman, of Jericho,
presented themselves and declared their intentions of marriage
with each, and this meeting appoints John Mott and
Micajah Mott to make enquiry into Elias Hicks, his clearness
in relation of marriage with other women, and to make
report at the next monthly meeting.</p>

<p>"At a monthly meeting in the meeting house at Westbury
ye 26th day of ye Twelfth month, 1770, Elias Hicks
and Jemima Seaman appeared the second time, and Elias
Hicks signified they continued their intentions of marriage
and desired an answer to their former proposals of marriage,
and the Friends who were appointed to make enquiry
into Elias' clearness reported that they had made enquiry,
and find nothing but that he is clear of marriage engagements
to other women, and they having consent of parents
and nothing appearing to <span class="correction" title="Originally: obestruct">obstruct</span> their proceedings in
marriage, this meeting leaves them to solemnize their marriage
according to the good order used amongst Friends,
and appoints Robert Seaman and John Mott to attend their
said marriage, and to make report to the next monthly
meeting it was consumated.</p>

<p>"On ye 30th day of ye First month, 1771, Robert Seaman
reported that they had attended the marriage of Elias
Hicks and Jemima Seaman, and was with them both at
Jericho and at Rockaway, and John Mott also reported that
he accompanied them at Rockaway and that the marriage
was consummated orderly."</p></blockquote>

<p>In more ways than one the marriage of Elias was the
important event of his life. Jemima Seaman was an only
child, and naturally her parents desired that she should be
near them. A few months after their marriage Elias and
Jemima were urged to take up their residence at the Sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>man
homestead, Elias to manage the farm of his father-in-law.
The result was that the farm in Jericho became the
home of Elias Hicks the remainder of his life. Here he
lived and labored for nearly sixty years.</p>

<p>The Seamans were concerned Friends, and the farm
was near the Friends' meeting house in Jericho. From this
dates his constant attendance at the meetings for worship
and discipline of the Society. Besides the family influence,
some of his neighbors, strong men and women, and deeply
attached to the principles and testimonies of Friends, made
for the young people an ideal and inspiring environment.
The Friends at Jericho could not have been unmindful of
the native ability and taking qualities of this young man,
whose fortunes were to be linked with their own, and whose
future labors were to be so singularly devoted to their
religious Society.</p>

<p>Jemima, the wife of Elias Hicks, was the daughter of
Jonathan and Elizabeth Seaman. The father of Jemima
was the fifth generation from Captain John Seaman, who
came to Long Island from the Connecticut mainland about
1660. For his time, he seems to have been a man of affairs,
and is recorded as one of the patentees of the town of
Hempstead, on the Sound side of the island. There was
a John Seaman who came to Massachusetts in the Winthrop
fleet of ten vessels and 900 immigrants in 1630. That form
of biography which shades into tradition is not agreed as
to whether Captain John, of Hempstead, was the Puritan
John or his son.</p>

<p>Running the family history back to England, we find
Lazarus Seaman, known as a Puritan divine, a native of
Leicester. He died in 1667. He is described as a learned
theologian, versed in the art of controversy, and stout in
defense of his position in religious matters.</p>

<p>The history of heraldry, and the story of the efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
to capture the holy sepulcher, tell us that John de Seaman
was one of the first crusaders. To this line the Seaman
lineage in America is believed to be attached.</p>

<p>At some time, whether in his early manhood is not
known, Elias Hicks took up surveying. How steadily or
extensively he followed that business it is impossible to say.
It is not hard, however, to find samples of his surveying
and plotting among the papers of Long Island conveyancers.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
His compass, and the home-made pine case in
which he kept the instrument and the tripod, are in existence.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
The compass is a simple affair, without a telescope,
of course. It folds into a flat shape, the box not being
more than two inches thick, over all.</p>

<p>There are many evidences in the Journal that Elias
Hicks appreciated the moral and spiritual advantages of his
environment after he took up his residence at Jericho. He
confesses, however, that as he had entered quite extensively
into business, he was much diverted from spiritual things
for a number of years after his marriage. During this
period he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was again brought, by the operative influence of
divine grace, under deep concern of mind; and was led,
through adorable mercy, to see that although I had ceased
from many sins and vanities of my youth, yet there were
many remaining that I was still guilty of, which were not
yet atoned for, and for which I now felt the judgments of
God to rest upon me. This caused me to cry earnestly to
the Most High for pardon and redemption, and he
graciously condescended to hear my cry, and to open a way
before me, wherein I must walk, in order to experience
reconciliation with him; and as I abode in watchfulness
and deep humiliation before him, light broke forth out of
obscurity, and my darkness became as the noonday. I had
many deep openings in the visions of light, greatly
strengthening and establishing to my exercised mind. My
spirit was brought under a close and weighty labour in
meetings for discipline, and my understanding much enlarged
therein; and I felt a concern to speak to some of the
subjects engaging the meeting's attention, which often
brought unspeakable comfort to my mind. About this time
I began to have openings leading to the ministry, which
brought me under close exercise and deep travail of spirit;
for although I had for some time spoken on subjects of
business in monthly and preparative meetings, yet the
prospect of opening my mouth in public meetings was a
close trial; but I endeavored to keep my mind quiet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
resigned to the heavenly call, if it should be made clear to
me to be my duty. Nevertheless, as I was, soon after,
sitting in a meeting, in much weightiness of spirit, a secret,
though clear, intimation accompanied me to speak a few
words, which were then given to me to utter, yet fear so
prevailed that I did not yield to the intimation. For this
omission I felt close rebuke, and judgment seemed, for some
time, to cover my mind; but as I humbled myself under
the Lord's mighty hand, he again lifted up the light of his
countenance upon me, and enabled me to renew covenant
with him, that if he would pass by this offense, I would,
in the future, be faithful, if he should again require such a
service of me. And it was not long before I felt an impressive
concern to utter a few words, which I yielded to in
great fear and dread; but oh, the joy and sweet consolation
that my soul experienced, as a reward for this act of faithfulness;
and as I continued persevering in duty and watchfulness,
I witnessed an increase in divine knowledge, and
an enlargement of my gift. I was also deeply engaged for
the right administration of discipline and order in the
church, and that all might be kept sweet and clean, <span class="correction" title="Originally: consitent">consistent</span>
with the nature and purity of the holy profession we
were making; so that all stumbling-blocks might be
removed out of the way of honest inquirers, and that truth's
testimony might be exalted, and the Lord's name magnified,
'who is over all, God blessed forever.'"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Journal, p. 15.</p></div>

<p>Still it appears that his concern for the maintenance
of the discipline was more than a slavish allegiance to
the letter of the law. More than once he spoke a warning
word as to the danger of allowing the administration
of the written rule to lead to mere formalism. Once begun,
his development in public service was rapid, and his recognition
by Friends cordial and appreciative to a marked
degree.</p>

<p>Just how long Elias Hicks spoke in the meetings for
worship, before his "acknowledgment," is not known. The
records of Westbury Monthly Meeting, however, give de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>tailed
information as to this event. From them we make
the following extract:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At a monthly meeting held at Westbury ye 29th of
Fourth month, 1778, William Seaman and William Valentine
report that they have made inquiry concerning Elias
Hicks, and find nothing to hinder his being recommended
to the meeting of Ministers and Elders, whom this meeting
recommends to that meeting as a minister, and directs the
clerk to forward a copy of this minute to said meeting."</p></blockquote>

<p>The acknowledgment of the ministry of Elias Hicks
took place a little over seven years after his marriage.
From various references in the Journal the inference is
warranted that he did not begin to speak in the meeting for
worship until a considerable time after this event. It is,
therefore, probable that his service in this line had not been
going on, at the most, more than three or four years when
his acknowledgment took place. He had only been a
recorded minister something over a year when his first considerable
visit was undertaken.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the preserved personal correspondence
of Elias Hicks does not cover this period in his life, so
that we are confined to what he chose to put in his Journal,
as the only self-interpretation of this interesting period.</p>

<p>It appears that the New York Yearly Meeting was
held at the regularly appointed times all through the period
of the Revolutionary War. Previous to 1777 the meeting
met annually at Flushing, but in that year the sessions were
removed to Westbury. In 1793 it was concluded to hold
future meetings in New York.</p>

<p>During the war the British controlled Long Island,
and for some time the meeting house in Flushing was occupied
as a barracks by the king's troops, which probably
accounts for moving the yearly meeting further out on the
island to Westbury.</p>

<p>In attending the yearly meeting, and in performing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
religious visits to the particular meetings, passing the lines
of both armies was a frequent necessity. This privilege
was freely granted Friends. Touching this matter, Elias
makes this reference:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This was a favor which the parties would not grant
to their best friends, who were of a warlike disposition;
which shows what great advantages would redound to
mankind were they all of this pacific spirit. I passed
myself through the lines of both armies six times during
the war without molestation, both parties generally receiving
me with openness and civility; and although I had to
pass over a tract of country, between the two armies, sometimes
more than thirty miles in extent, and which was much
frequented by robbers, a set, in general, of cruel, unprincipled
banditti, issuing out from both parties, yet, excepting
once, I met with no interruption even from them. But
although Friends in general experienced many favors and
deliverances, yet those scenes of war and confusion occasioned
many trials and provings in various ways to the
faithful."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Early Labors in the Ministry.</p>


<p>Probably the first official public service to which Elias
Hicks was ever assigned by the Society related to a matter
growing out of the Revolutionary War. Under the new
meeting-house in New York was a large room, usually
rented for commercial purposes. During the British occupation
this room was appropriated as a storehouse for military
goods. The rent was finally tendered by the military
commissioner to some representative Friends, and by them
accepted. This caused great concern to many members of
the meeting, who felt that the Society of Friends could not
consistently be the recipient of money from such a source.
The matter came before the Yearly Meeting in 1779. The
peace party felt that the rent money was blood money, and
should be returned, but a vigorous minority sustained the
recipients of this warlike revenue. It was finally decided to
refer the matter to the Yearly Meeting of Pennsylvania for
determination. A committee to carry the matter to Philadelphia
was appointed, of which Elias Hicks, then a young
man of thirty-one, was a member.</p>

<p>He made this service the occasion for some religious
visits, which he, in company with his friend, John Willis,
proceeded to make <i>en route</i>. The two Friends left home
Ninth month 9, 1779, but took a roundabout route in
order to visit the meetings involved in the concern of Elias.
Instead of crossing over into New Jersey and going directly
to Philadelphia, they went up the Hudson valley to a point
above Newburgh, visiting meetings on both sides of the
river. Their most northern point was the meeting at Marl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>borough,
in Ulster County, New York. They then turned
to the southwest, and visited the meetings at Hardwick<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and
Kingwood, arriving at Philadelphia, Ninth month 25th.
Elias attended all the sittings of the yearly meeting until
Fourth-day, when he was taken ill, and was not able to be
in attendance after that time. He was not present when
the matter which called the committee to Philadelphia was
considered. The decision, however, was that the money
received by the New York meeting for rent paid by the
British army should be returned. This was done by direction
of New York Yearly Meeting in 1780. It may be
interesting to note that in 1779 the Yearly Meeting of
Pennsylvania began with the Meeting of Ministers and
Elders; Seventh-day, the 25th of Ninth month, and continued
until Second-day, the 4th of Tenth month, having
practically been in session a week and two days.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Hardwick was in Sussex County, New Jersey. It was the home
meeting of Benjamin Lundy, the abolitionist.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> From 1755 to 1798, Philadelphia Yearly Meeting was held in
Ninth month.</p></div>

<p>Following the Yearly Meeting in Philadelphia, the
meeting at Byberry was visited, as were those at Wrightstown,
Plumstead and Buckingham, in Bucks County, Pa.
On the return trip he was again at Hardwick, after which
he passed to the eastern shore of the Hudson, and was at
Nine Partners, Oswego and Oblong. Turning southward,
the meetings at Peach Pond, Amawalk and Purchase were
visited. From the latter point he journeyed homeward.</p>

<p>This first religious journey of Elias Hicks lasted nine
weeks, and in making it he traveled 860 miles. Forty years
later, many of the places visited at this time became centers
of the troublesome controversy which divided the Society
in 1827 and 1828.</p>

<p>Four years after the concern and service which took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
Elias Hicks to Philadelphia in 1779, he undertook his
second recorded religious visit. It was a comparatively
short one, and took him to the Nine Partners neighborhood.
He was absent from home on this trip eleven days,
and traveled 170 miles.</p>

<p>In 1784 Elias had a concern to visit neighborhoods in
Long Island not Friendly in their character. He made one
trip, and not feeling free of the obligations resting upon
him, he made a second tour. During the two visits he rode
about 200 miles.</p>

<p>He seems to have had a period of quiet home service
for about six years, or until 1790, when two somewhat extended
concerns were followed. The first took him to the
meetings in the western part of Long Island, to New York
City and Staten Island. This trip caused him to travel 150
miles. The next visiting tour covered a wide extent of territory,
and took him to eastern New York and Vermont.
On this trip he was gone from home about four weeks, and
traveled 591 miles.</p>

<p>The year 1791 was more than usually active. Besides
another visit to those not Friends on Long Island, he made
a general visit to Friends in New York Yearly Meeting.
This visit took him to New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts
and up the Hudson valley as far as Easton and
Saratoga. The Long Island visit consumed two weeks'
time, and involved traveling 115 miles. On the general
visit he was absent from home four months and eleven
days, and traveled 1500 miles.</p>

<p>In 1792 a committee, of which Elias was a member,
was appointed by the Yearly Meeting of Ministers and
Elders to visit subordinate meetings of that branch of the
Society. In company with these Friends every meeting
of Ministers and Elders was visited, and a number of meetings
for worship were attended. On this trip he was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
Claremont, in Massachusetts, and desired to have an
appointed meeting. It seemed that the person, not a
Friend, who was to arrange for this meeting did not
advertise it, for fear it would turn out a silent meeting,
and he would be laughed to scorn. The attendance was
very small, but otherwise satisfactory, so that the fearful
person was very penitent, and desired that another meeting
might be held. Elias says: "But we let him know that
we were not at our own disposal; and, as no way appeared
open in our minds for such an appointment at present, we
could not comply with his desire."</p>

<p>An appointed meeting was also held near Dartmouth
College, but the students were hilarious, and the occasion
very much disturbed. Still, the visitor hoped "the season
was profitable to some present."</p>

<p>In the following year, 1793, he had a concern to visit
Friends in New England, during which he attended meetings
in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine
and the Massachusetts islands. On this trip he traveled by
land or on water 2283 miles, and was absent about five
months. It may be interesting to note that the traveling
companion of Elias Hicks on the New England visit was
James Mott, of Mamaroneck, N. Y., the maternal grandfather
of James Mott,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the husband of Lucretia.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Adam Mott, the father of Lucretia's husband, married Anne,
daughter of James Mott.</p></div>

<p>The New England Yearly Meeting was attended at
Newport. The meeting was pronounced a "dull time" by
the visitor. This was occasioned in part, he thought, because
a very small number took upon "them the whole management
of the business, and thereby shutting up the way
to others, and preventing the free circulation and spreading
of the concern, in a proper manner, on the minds of Friends;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
which I have very often found to be a very hurtful
tendency."</p>

<p>It seems that in those days the Meeting of Ministers
and Elders exercised the functions of a visiting committee.
Accordingly, the Yearly Meeting of Ministers and Elders
in 1795 appointed a committee to visit the quarterly and
preparative meetings within the bounds of the Yearly Meeting.
As a member of this committee, Elias performed his
share of this round of service. On this visit a large number
of families were visited.</p>

<p>The visits were made seasons of counsel and advice,
especially in the "select meetings." In these, he says, "My
mind was led to communicate some things in a plain way,
with a view of stirring them up to more diligence and circumspection
in their families, the better ordering and disciplining
of their children and household, and keeping
things sweet and clean, agreeably to the simplicity of our
holy profession; and I had peace in my labor."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Journal, p. 57.</p></div>

<p>Possibly his most extended visit up to that time was
made in 1798. The trip was really begun Twelfth month
12, 1797. It included meeting's in New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. On this trip he
was from home five and one-half months, traveled 1600
miles, and attended 143 meetings, nearly an average of one
meeting a day.</p>

<p>It was on this journey that he seriously began his
public opposition to the institution of slavery. On the 12th
of Third month, at a meeting at Elk Ridge, Md., he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Truth rose into dominion, and some present who
were <span class="correction" title="Originally: slave-holders">slaveholders</span> were made sensible of their condition,
and were much affected. I felt a hope to arise that the
opportunity would prove profitable to some, and I left them
with peace of mind. Since then I have been informed that
a woman present at that session, who possessed a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
of slaves, was so fully convinced, as to set them free, and
not long afterwards joined in membership with Friends;
which is indeed cause of gratitude and thankfulness of
heart, to the great and blessed Author of every mercy
vouchsafed to the children of men."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Journal, p. 67.</p></div>

<p>His personal correspondence on this trip yields some
interesting description of experiences, from which we make
the following extract, from a letter written to his wife
from "Near Easton, Talbot County, Maryland, Second
month 12, 1798":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mary Berry, an ancient ministering Friend, that Job
Scott makes mention of, was with us at the meeting. On
Seventh-day we attended a meeting with the black people
at Easton, which we had appointed some days before.
There was a pretty large number attended, and the opportunity
favoured. Mary Berry observed she thought it was
the most so, of any that had ever been with them. They
were generally very solid, and many of them very tender.
The white people complained much of some of them for
their bad conduct, but according to my feeling, many of
them appeared much higher in the kingdom than a great
many of the whites.</p>

<p>"Some days past we were with the people called
Nicolites. They dress very plain, many of them mostly in
white. The women wore white bonnets as large as thine,
and in form like thy old-fashioned bonnet, straight and
smooth on the top. In some of their meetings three or four
of the foremost seats would be filled with those who mostly
had on these white bonnets. They have no backs to their
seats, nor no rising seats in their meeting-houses. All sat
on a level. They appear like a pretty honest, simple
people. Profess our principles, and most of them, by their
request, have of late been joined to Friends, and I think
many of them are likely to become worthy members of
Society, if the example of the backsliders among us do not
stumble or turn them out of the right way. There was
about 100 received by Friends here at their last monthly
meeting, and are like for the first time to attend here next
Fifth-day, which made it the more pressing on my mind
to tarry over that day."</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Later Ministerial Labors.</p>


<p>In the fall of 1799 a concern to visit meetings in
Connecticut was followed. The trip also took in most of
the meetings on the east bank of the Hudson as far north
as Dutchess County. He was absent six weeks, and
attended thirty meetings.</p>

<p>Fourth month 11, 1801, Elias and his traveling companion,
Edmund Willis, started, on a visit to "Friends in
some parts of Jersey, Pennsylvania, and some places
adjacent thereto." A number of meetings in New Jersey
were visited on the way, the travelers arriving in Philadelphia
in time for the Yearly Meeting of Ministers and Elders.
All of the sessions of the yearly meeting were also attended.
It does not appear that Elias Hicks had attended this yearly
meeting since 1779. Practically all of the meetings in New
Jersey and Pennsylvania were visited on this trip. It lasted
three months and eighteen days, during which time the
visitors traveled 1630 miles.</p>

<p>The personal correspondence of Elias Hicks yields one
interesting letter written on this trip. It was written to his
wife, and was dated "Exeter, 4th of Seventh month, 1801."
We quote as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We did not get to Lampeter so soon as I expected,
as mentioned in my last, for when we left Yorktown last
Fourth-day evening, being late before we set out, detained
in part by a shower of rain. It was night by the time we
got over the river. We landed in a little town called Columbia,
where dwelt a few friends. Although being anxious
to get forward, I had previous to coming there intended to
pass them without a meeting, but found when there I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
not safely do it. Therefore we appointed a meeting there
the next day, after which we rode to Lampeter, to William
Brinton's, of whom, when I went westward, I got a fresh
horse, and I left mine in his care. I have now my own
again, but she has a very bad sore on her withers, somewhat
like is called a 'thistlelon,' but is better than she has
been. It is now just six weeks and four days since we went
from this place, which is about 48 miles from Philadelphia,
since which time we have rode 813 miles and attended 35
meetings. Much of the way in this tour has been rugged,
mountainous and rocky, and had it not been for the best
attendant companion, peace of mind flowing from a compliance
with and performance of manifested duty, the journey
would have been tedious and irksome. But we passed
pretty cheerfully on, viewing with an attentive eye the
wonderful works of that boundless wisdom and power (by
which the worlds were framed) and which are only circumscribed
within the limits of their own innate excellency.
Here we beheld all nature almost with its varied and almost
endless diversifications.</p>

<p>"Tremendous precipices, rocks and mountains, creeks
and rivers, intersecting each other, all clothed in their
natural productions; the tall pines and sturdy oaks towering
their exalted heads above the clouds, interspersed with
beautiful lawns and glades; together with the almost innumerable
vegetable inhabitants, all blooming forth the
beauties of the spring; the fields arable, clothed in rich
pastures of varied kinds, wafted over the highways their
balmy sweets, and the fallow grounds overspread with rich
grain, mostly in golden wheat, to a profusion beyond anything
of the kind my eyes ever before beheld, insomuch that
the sensible traveler, look which way he would, could
scarcely help feeling his mind continually inflamed and
inspired with humble gratitude and reverent thankfulness
to the great and bountiful author of all those multiplied
blessings."</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter constitutes one of the few instances where
Elias Hicks referred to experiences on the road, not directly
connected with his ministerial duty. The reference to
Columbia, and his original intention to pass by without a
meeting, with its statement he "could not safely do it," is
characteristic. Manifestly, he uses the word "safely" in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
spiritual sense. The call to minister there was too certain
to be put aside for mere personal inclination and comfort.</p>

<p>The reference to his horse contains more than a passing
interest. Probably many other cases occurred during
his visits when "borrowing" a horse was necessary, while
his own was recuperating. It was a slow way to travel,
from our standpoint, yet it had its advantages. New
acquaintances, if not friendships, were made as the travelers
journeyed and were entertained on the road.</p>

<p>On the 20th of Ninth month, 1803, Elias Hicks, with
Daniel Titus as a traveling companion, started on a visit
to Friends in Upper Canada, and those resident in the part
of the New York Yearly Meeting located in the Hudson
and Mohawk valleys. When the travelers had been from
home a little less than a month, Elias wrote to his wife,
from Kingston, a letter of more than ordinary interest, because
of its descriptive quality. It describes some of the
difficulties, not to say dangers, of the traveling Friend
before the days of railroads. We quote the bulk of the
letter, which was dated Tenth month, 16, 1803:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We arrived here the 3d instant at the house of Joseph
Ferris about 3 o'clock at night, having rode the preceding
day from Samuel Brown's at Black River, where I dated
my last. We traveled by land and water in this day's
journey about forty-five miles. Very bad traveling over
logs and mudholes, crossing two ferries on our way, each
four or five miles wide, with an island between called Long
Island. About six miles across we were in the middle
thereof, the darkest time in the night, when we were under
the necessity of getting off our horses several times to feel
for the horses' tracks in order to know whether we were
in the path or not, as we were not able to see the path,
nor one another at times, if more than five or six feet apart.
Some of our company began to fear we should be under
the necessity of lying in the woods all night. However,
we were favored to get well through, and crossed the last
ferry about midnight and after. Landed safely on Kingston
shore about 2 o'clock, all well. Since which we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
attended ten meetings, three of them preparative meetings,
the rest mostly among other people. We just now, this
evening, returned from the last held at the house of John
Everit, about four miles west of Kingston. We held one
yesterday in the town of Kingston in their Court House.
It was the first Friends' meeting ever held in that place.
The principal inhabitants generally attended, and we have
thankfully to acknowledge that the shepherd of Israel in
whom was our trust, made bare his arm for our help, setting
home the testimony he gave us to the states of the
people, thereby manifesting that he had not left himself
without a witness in their hearts, as all appeared to yield
their assent to the truths delivered, which has generally
been the case, in every place where our lots have been
cast.</p>

<p>"We expect to-morrow to return on our way to Adolphustown,
taking some meetings in our way thither, among
those not of our Society, but so as to be there ready to
attend Friends' monthly that is held next Fifth-day, after
which we have some prospect of being at liberty to return
on our way back, into our own State.</p>

<p>"Having thus given thee a short account of our journey,
I may salute thee in the fresh feelings of endeared
affection, and strength of gospel love, in which fervent desires
are felt for thy preservation, and that of our dear
children, and that you may all so act and so walk, as to be
a comfort and strength to each other, and feel an evidence
in yourselves that the Lord is your friend; for you are my
friend (said the blessed redeemer) if you do whatever I
command you."</p></blockquote>

<p>For the three following years there is no record of
special activity, but in 1806 a somewhat extended visit was
made to Friends in the State of New York. He was absent
from home nearly two months, traveled over 1000 miles,
attended three quarterly, seventeen monthly, sixteen preparative,
and forty meetings for worship.</p>

<p>The years following, including 1812, were spent either
at home or in short, semi-occasional visits, mostly within the
bounds of his own yearly meeting. During this period a
visit to Canada Half-Yearly Meeting was made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>The first half of 1813 he was busy in his business and
domestic concerns, really preparing for a religious journey,
which he began on the 8th of Fifth month. He passed
through New Jersey on the way, attending meetings in that
State, either regular or by appointment, arriving in Philadelphia
in about two weeks. Several meetings in the
vicinity of that city were attended, whence he passed into
Delaware and Maryland. His steps were retraced through
New Jersey, when he was homeward bound.</p>

<p>From 1813 to 1816 we find the gospel labors of Elias
Hicks almost entirely confined to his own yearly meeting.
This round of service did not take him farther from home
than Dutchess County. During this period we find him
repeatedly confessing indisposition and bodily ailment,
which may have accounted for the fewness and moderateness
of his religious visits.</p>

<p>In First month, 1816, we find him under a concern to
visit Friends in New England. He had as his traveling
companion on this journey his friend and kinsman, Isaac
Hicks, of Westbury. During this trip practically all of the
meetings in New England were visited. It kept him from
home about three months, and caused him to travel upward
of 1000 miles. He attended fifty-nine particular, three
monthly and two quarterly meetings.</p>

<p>During the balance of 1816 and part of the year 1817,
service was principally confined to the limits of Westbury
Quarterly Meeting. But it was in no sense a period of
idleness. Many visits were made to meetings. In Eighth
month of the latter year, in company with his son-in-law,
Valentine Hicks, a visit was made to some of the meetings
attached to Philadelphia and Baltimore Yearly Meetings.
Many meetings in New Jersey and Pennsylvania received a
visit at this time. He went as far south as Loudon
County, Va., taking meetings <i>en route</i>, both going and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
coming. He must have traveled not less than 1000 miles
on this trip.</p>

<p>Visits near at home, and one to some parts of New
York Yearly Meeting, occupied all his time during the
year 1818.</p>

<p>In 1819 a general visit to Friends in his own yearly
meeting engaged his attention. He went to the Canadian
border. This trip was a season of extended service and
deep exercise. On this journey he traveled 1084 miles, was
absent from home fourteen weeks, and attended seventy-three
meetings for worship, three quarterly meetings and
four monthly meetings.</p>

<p>The years from 1819 to 1823, inclusive, were particularly
active. Elias Hicks was seventy-one in the former
year. The real stormy period of his life was approaching
in the shape of the unfortunate misunderstanding and bitterness
which divided the Society. It scarcely demands
more than passing mention here, as later on we shall give
deserved prominence to the "separation" period.</p>

<p>He started on the Ohio trip Eighth month 17, 1819,
taking northern and central Pennsylvania on his route. He
arrived in Mt. Pleasant in time for Ohio Yearly Meeting,
which seems to have been a most satisfactory occasion,
with no signs of the storm that broke over the same meeting
a few years later. Elias himself says: "It was thought,
I believe, by Friends, to have been the most favored yearly
meeting they had had since its institution, and was worthy of
grateful remembrance."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> During this visit many appointed
meetings were held, besides regular meetings for worship.
On the homeward journey, Friends in the Shenandoah
Valley, in Virginia, and in parts of Maryland were visited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
On this trip he journeyed 1200 miles, was from home three
months, and attended eighty-seven meetings.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Journal, p. 377.</p></div>

<p>In 1820 a visit was made to Farmington and Duanesburg
Quarterly Meetings, and in the summer of 1822 he
visited Friends in some parts of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting.
On this trip the Baltimore Yearly Meeting was also
visited, as were some of the particular meetings in Maryland.
He did not reach Philadelphia on the return journey
until the early part of Twelfth month. While his Journal
is singularly silent about the matter, it must have been on
this visit that he encountered his first public opposition
as a minister. But, with few exceptions, the Journal
ignores the whole unpleasantness.</p>

<p>In 1824 he again attended Baltimore Yearly Meeting.
The only comment on this trip is the following: "I think it
was, in its several sittings, one of the most satisfactory
yearly meetings I have ever attended, and the business was
conducted in much harmony and brotherly love."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>On the homeward trip he stopped in Philadelphia.
Here he suffered a severe illness. Of this detention at that
time he says: "I lodged at the house of my kind friend,
Samuel R. Fisher, who, with his worthy children, extended
to me the most affectionate care and attention; and I had
also the kind sympathy of a large portion of Friends in
that city."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The exception contained in this sentence is
the only intimation that all was not unity and harmony
among Friends in the "City of Brotherly Love."</p>

<p>His visits in 1825 were confined to the meetings on
Long Island and those in central New York.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the following year he secured a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
minute to visit meetings composing Concord and Southern
Quarterly Meetings, within the bounds of Philadelphia
Yearly Meeting. In passing through Philadelphia he
attended Green Street and Mulberry Street Meetings. This
was within a few months of the division of 1827 in Philadelphia
Yearly Meeting, but the matter is not mentioned
in the Journal.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Religious Journeys in 1828.</p>


<p>On the 20th of Third month, 1828, Elias Hicks laid
before Jericho Monthly Meeting a concern he had to make
"a religious visit in the love of the gospel, to Friends and
others in some parts of our own yearly meeting, and in the
compass of the Yearly Meetings of Philadelphia, Baltimore,
Ohio, Indiana, and a few meetings in Virginia." A minute
embodying this concern was granted him, the same receiving
the indorsement of Westbury Quarterly Meeting,
Fourth month 24th. Between this period and the middle
of Sixth month he made a visit to Dutchess County, where
the experience with Ann Jones and her husband took place,
which will be dealt with in a separate chapter. He also
attended New York Yearly Meeting, when he saw and was
a part of the "separation" trouble which culminated at that
time. The Journal, however, makes no reference either to
the Dutchess County matter or to the division in the yearly
meeting. These silences in the Journal are hard to understand.
Undoubtedly, the troubles of the period were not
pleasant matters of record, yet one wishes that a fuller and
more detailed statement regarding the whole matter might
be had from Elias Hicks than is contained in the meager
references in his personal correspondence, or his published
Journal.</p>

<p>On the 14th of Sixth month he started on the western
and southern journey, with his friend, Jesse Merritt, as his
traveling companion. Elias was then a few months past
eighty.</p>

<p>The two Friends halted at points in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania, holding meetings as the way opened. Service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
continued in Pennsylvania, considerably in the western part,
passing from Pittsburg into Ohio.</p>

<p>At Westland Monthly Meeting, in Pennsylvania, his
first acknowledgment of opposition is observed. He says:
"A Friend from abroad attended this meeting, and after I
sat down he rose and made opposition, which greatly disturbed
the meeting."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Thomas Shillitoe.</p></div>

<p>When he arrived at Brownsville, his fame had preceded
him. He makes this reference to the experience
there:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Here we put up again with our kind friends Jesse and
Edith Townsend, where we had the company of many
Friends, and many of the inhabitants of the town not members
of our Society, also came in to see us; as the unfounded
reports of those who style themselves Orthodox,
having been generally spread over the country, it created
such a great excitement in the minds of the people at large,
that multitudes flocked to the meetings where we were, to
hear for themselves; and many came to see us, and acknowledged
their satisfaction.</p>

<p>"At this place we again fell in with the Friend from
abroad, who attended the meeting with us; he rose in
the early part of the meeting, and continued his communication
so long that a number left the meeting, by
which it became very much unsettled: however, when he
sat down I felt an opening to stand up; and the people
returned and crowded into the house, and those that could
not get in stood about the doors and windows, and a
precious solemnity soon spread over the meeting, which has
been the case in every meeting, where our opposers did
not make disturbance by their disorderly conduct. The
meeting closed in a quiet and orderly manner, and I was
very thankful for the favour."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Journal, p. 404.</p></div>

<p>Following his experience at Brownsville, Elias returned
to Westland, attending the meeting of ministers and
elders, and the meeting for worship. The person before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
mentioned, who may be called the "disturbing Friend," was
again in evidence, this time reinforced by a "companion."
At the instigation of Friends, the elders and overseers had
"an opportunity" with the disturbers, but with small success.
The same trouble was repeated on First-day. On
this occasion the opposition was vigorous and virulent. In
the midst of the second opportunity of the opposing Friend
the audience melted away, leaving him literally without
hearers.</p>

<p>From Westland the journey was continued to Pittsburg,
where an appointed meeting was held. Salem, Ohio,
was the next point visited, where the quarterly meeting was
attended. On First-day a large company, estimated at
two thousand, gathered. The occasion was in every way
satisfactory. Visits to different meetings continued. There
was manifest opposition at New Garden, Springfield,
Goshen and Marlborough. At Smithfield the venerable
preacher was quite indisposed. The meeting-house was
closed against him, by "those called Orthodox," as Elias
defined them.</p>

<p>One of the objective points on this trip was Mt. Pleasant,
Ohio, where the yearly meeting of 1828 was held.
He arrived in time to attend the mid-week meeting at that
place, a week preceding the yearly meeting. A large
attendance was reported, many being present who were not
members of the Society. The signs of trouble had preceded
the distinguished visitor, the "world's people" having a
phenomenal curiosity regarding a possible war among the
peaceable Quakers. There was pronounced antagonism
manifested in this mid-week meeting, described as "a long,
tedious communication from a minister among those called
Orthodox, who, after I sat down, publicly opposed and
endeavored to lay waste what I had said."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Journal, p. 411.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span></p></div>

<p>During the following days meetings were attended at
Short Creek, Harrisville, West Grove, Concord, St. Clairsville,
Plainfield, Wrightstown and Stillwater. There was no
recorded disturbance until he returned to Mt. Pleasant the
6th of Ninth month, the date of the gathering of the
Yearly Meeting of Ministers and Elders. When the meeting-house
was reached the gate to the yard was guarded,
"by a number of men of the opposing party," who refused
entrance to those who were in sympathy with Elias Hicks.
They proceeded to hold their meeting in the open air. Subsequent
meetings were held in a school-house and in a
private house, the home of Israel French.</p>

<p>First-day, Ninth month 7th, Mt. Pleasant Meeting was
attended in the forenoon, and Short Creek Meeting in the
afternoon. The meeting at Mt. Pleasant was what might
be called stormy. Elisha Bates and Ann Braithwaite spoke
in opposition, after Elias Hicks had spoken. In a letter
dated Ninth month 10th, written to his son-in-law, Valentine
Hicks, Elias says that these Friends "detained the
meeting two hours or more, opposing and railing against
what I had said, until the people were wearied and much
disgusted." No trouble was experienced at Short Creek,
although experiences similar to those of the morning
occurred at Mt. Pleasant in the afternoon. Amos Peaslee,
of Woodbury, N. J., was the center of opposition at that
time. He was opposed while on his feet addressing the
multitude.</p>

<p>In connection with this yearly meeting a number of
Friends were arrested on charges of trespass and inducing
a riot, and taken to court. All were members of Ohio
Yearly Meeting, except Halliday Jackson,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of Darby, Pa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
For some reason Elias escaped arrest, although in the letter
referred to he said: "I have been expecting for several
days past to have a writ of trespass served against me by
the sheriff, for going on their meeting-house grounds, by
which I may be taken twenty miles or more to appear before
the judge, as a number of Friends already have been,
although my mind is quiet regarding the event."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Halliday Jackson was father of John Jackson, the well-known
educator, principal of Sharon Hill School. Halliday was with the
Seneca Indians in New York State for two years, as a teacher under
the care of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting.</p></div>

<p>While at Mt. Pleasant the small monthly meeting of
Orthodox Friends at his home sent a letter "officially" commanding
Elias to cease his religious visits. In regard to
this matter, and the general situation in Ohio, Elias wrote
to Valentine Hicks: "The Orthodox in this yearly meeting
are, if possible, tenfold more violent than in any other part
of the Society. Gideon Seaman, and his associates in the
little upstart Monthly Meeting of Westbury and Jericho,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
have sent a very peremptory order for me to return immediately
home, and not proceed any further on my religious
visit, by which they trample the authority of our quarterly
and monthly meeting under foot."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> The Monthly Meeting of Westbury and Jericho was made up
of a small number of Orthodox Friends, representing only a small
minority of the meeting of which Elias Hicks was a member.</p></div>

<p>Following the Ohio Yearly Meeting, Flushing,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in that
State, was visited, and the First-day meeting attended.
Elias was met before he reached the meeting-house by
Orthodox Friends, who insisted that he should not interrupt
the meeting. He entered the house, but before the
meeting was fairly settled, Charles Osborn, an Orthodox
Friend, appeared in prayer, and continued for an hour; and
then preached for another hour. Elias thus refers to this
occurrence:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Flushing is about 18 miles from Mt. Pleasant. A Wilburite
meeting is the only Friendly gathering now in the place.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"However, when he sat down, although the meeting
was much wearied with his long and tedious communica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>tions,
I felt the necessity of standing up and addressing
the people, which brought a precious solemnity over the
meeting; but as soon as I sat down, he rose again to contradict,
and tried to lay waste my communication, by
asserting that I had not the unity of my friends at home;
which being untrue, I therefore informed the meeting that
I had certificates with me to prove the incorrectness of his
assertions, which I then produced, but he and his party
would not stay to hear them, but in a disorderly manner
arose and left the meeting; but the people generally stayed
and heard them read, to their general satisfaction."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Meetings were subsequently attended at different points
in Ohio, generally without disturbance, until Springfield
was reached the 22d of Ninth month. Here the Orthodox
shut the meeting-house and guarded the doors. Elias held
his meeting under some trees nearby. He says: "It was
a precious season, wherein the Lord's power and love were
exalted over all opposition."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Preceding Indiana Yearly Meeting, he was twice at
Wilmington, Ohio, and attended monthly meeting at Center,
the first held since the "separation." The attendance was
large, many more than the house would accommodate.
Elias says: "The Lord, our never-failing helper, manifested
his presence, solemnizing the assembly and opening the
minds of the people to receive the word preached; breaking
down all opposition, and humbling and contriting the
assembly in a very general manner."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Ninth month 27th, Indiana Yearly Meeting convened
at Waynesville, Ohio. It should be noted that the "separation"
in most of the meetings comprising this yearly
meeting had been accomplished in 1827, so that the gather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>ing
in 1828 was in substantial unity with the Friends in
sympathy with Elias Hicks. A letter written to Valentine
and Abigail Hicks, dated Waynesville, Tenth month 3,
1828, contains some interesting information concerning the
experience of the venerable preacher. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Yearly Meeting here would have been very large,
had there not been a failure of the information of the conclusion
for holding it here, reaching divers of the Quarterly
Meetings, by which they were prevented from attending.
The meeting was very orderly conducted, and the business
managed in much harmony and condescension. The public
meetings have been very large, favoured seasons, and all the
meetings we have attended in our passing along have been
generally very large. Seldom any houses were found large
enough to contain the people. Often hundreds were under
the necessity of standing out doors. Many of the people
without came a great way to be at our meeting. Some ten,
some twenty, and some thirty miles, and I have been informed
since I have been here that the people in a town
120 miles below Cincinnati have given it in charge to
Friends of that place to inform them when we came there,
as a steam boat plies between the two places. The excitement
is so great among the people by the false rumors
circulated by the Orthodox, that they spare no pains to get
an opportunity to be with us, and those who have attended
from distant parts, informing the people the satisfaction
they have had in being with us, in which they have found
that the reports spread among them were generally false,
it has increased the excitement in others to see for themselves."</p></blockquote>

<p>The yearly meeting over, Elias attended meetings <i>en
route</i> to Richmond, Ind., and was at the mid-week meeting
in that place, Tenth month 8th. Several other meetings
were attended, the only disturbance reported being at
Orange, where the Orthodox "hurt the meeting very considerably."
On the 19th he was in Cincinnati, and attended
the regular meeting in the morning, and a large appointed
meeting in the court-house in the afternoon. Both were
pronounced "highly favored seasons."</p>

<p>First-day, the 26th, he was at Fairfield, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>
Orthodox revived the story that he was traveling without
a minute. While Elias was speaking, the Orthodox left
the meeting in a body. He remarks: "But Friends and
others kept their seats, and we had a very solemn close, and
great brokenness and contrition were manifest among the
people; and to do away with the false report spread by the
Orthodox, I had my certificates read, which gave full satisfaction
to the assembly."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Elias then journeyed to Wheeling, his face being
turned homeward. He held an appointed meeting in that
city. It is suggestive that, notwithstanding the theological
odium under which he was supposed to rest, the meeting
was held in the Methodist church, which had been kindly
offered for the purpose. This would seem to indicate that
the Methodists had not yet taken any sides in the quarrel
which had divided the <span class="correction" title="Originally: Soicety">Society</span> of Friends.</p>

<p>After visiting Redstone Quarterly Meeting, in western
Pennsylvania, he visited the meetings in the Shenandoah
and Loudon valleys, in Virginia. He was at Alexandria
and Washington, and on First-day, Eleventh month 16th,
was at Sandy Spring, Md. The meetings about Baltimore
and in Harford and Cecil counties were visited. He
reached West Grove in Pennsylvania, Twelfth month 1st,
and encountered some trouble, as he found that the meeting-house
had been closed against him. A large crowd assembled,
better councils prevailed, and the house was opened.
The audience was beyond the capacity of the house, and the
meeting in every way satisfactory.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at West Grove, Twelfth month 1st,
he sent a letter to his son-in-law and daughter, Royal and
Martha Aldrich. In this letter he gives a brief account of
his experiences in Maryland and Lancaster County. He
says: "The aforesaid meetings were very large and highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
favored, generally made up of every description of people,
high and low, rich and poor, Romanists, and generally some
of every profession of Protestants known in our country.
Generally all went away fully satisfied as to those evil
reports that have been spread over the country concerning
me, and many announced the abhorrence they had of those
false and slanderous reports."</p>

<p>It appears from this letter that the traveling companion
of Elias, Jesse Merritt, was homesick, and hoped that some
other Friend would come from Long Island to take his place
for the rest of the trip. In case such a shift was made,
Elias requested that whoever came "might bring with him
my best winter tight-bodied coat, and two thicker neck-cloths,
as those I have are rather thin. I got a new great-coat
in Alexandria, and shall not need any other."</p>

<p>From a letter written to his wife from West Chester,
Twelfth month 7th, we learn that John Hicks had arrived
to take the place of Jesse Merritt, and he seized that opportunity
to send a letter home. As the two Friends had been
away from home nearly six months, it is not strange that
the companion on this journey desired to return. He could
scarcely have been under the deep and absorbing religious
concern which was felt by his elder brother in the truth.
The nature of this obligation is revealed in the letter last
noted. In this epistle to his wife, Elias says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Abigail's letter informs of the infirm state of V. and
Caroline, which excites near-feeling and sympathy with
them, and which would induce me to return home immediately
if I was set at liberty from my religious obligations,
but as that is not the case, I can only recommend them to
the preserving care and compassionate regard of our
Heavenly Father, whose mercy is over all his works and
does not suffer a sparrow to fall without his notice. And
as we become resigned to his heavenly disposals, he will
cause all things to work together for good, to his truly
devoted children. Therefore, let all trust in him, for in the
Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>The meetings in Delaware, eastern Pennsylvania and
New Jersey were pretty generally attended, and with no
reported disturbance. First-day, the 21st of Twelfth
month, Elias attended the meeting at Cherry Street in the
morning and Green Street in the afternoon, and on the 28th
he repeated that experience. On both occasions "hundreds
more assembled than the houses could contain."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In the
suburban meetings in Delaware and Bucks Counties, "the
houses were generally too small to contain the people; many
had to stand out-of-doors for want of room; nevertheless,
the people behaved orderly and the Lord was felt to preside,
solemnizing those crowded assemblies, in all of which my
mind was opened, and ability afforded, to preach the gospel
to the people in the demonstration of the spirit and with
power, and many hearts were broken and contrited and went
away rejoicing, under thankful sense of the unmerited
favor."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The great crowds which flocked to hear Elias Hicks
after the "separation" were probably called together partly
because of curiosity on their part, and to a considerable
extent because of his continued popularity as a minister, in
spite of the trouble which had come to the Society. That
he was appreciative of what we would now call the advertising
quality of those who antagonized him, and became
his theological and personal enemies, is well attested. In
summing up his conclusions regarding the long religious
visit now under review, he said: "My opposing brethren
had, by their public opposition and erroneous reports,
created such excitement in the minds of the people generally
of every profession, that it induced multitudes to assemble
to hear for themselves, and they generally went away satis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>fied
and comforted."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Undoubtedly, the multitudes who
heard Elias Hicks preach in 1828 went away wondering
what all the trouble was about.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> Journal, p. 423.</p></div>

<p>Elias and his traveling companion reached home about
the middle of First month, 1829. This was one of the
longest and most extended religious journeys ever made
by him, and was completed within two months of his
eighty-first year. On the journey he traveled nearly 2400
miles, and was absent seven months and ten days.</p>

<p>Going carefully over the various journeys of this well-known
minister, a conservative estimate will show that he
traveled in the aggregate not less than forty thousand miles
during his long life of public service. He was probably
the best-known minister in the Society of Friends in his
time. His circle of personal friends was large, and extended
over all the yearly meetings. It is necessary to
keep these facts in mind, in order to understand how the
major portion of Friends at that time made his cause their
own when the rupture came.</p>

<p>The majority of Friends at that time were content as
to preaching, with words that seemed to be full of spirit
and life, and this undoubtedly was characteristic of the
preaching of Elias Hicks. To attempt to destroy the standing
in the Society of a man of such character and equipment
was certain to break something other than the man attacked.
This will become more apparent as we consider more closely
the relation of Elias Hicks to the controversy with which
his name and person were linked, and with the trouble in
the Society of Friends, for which, either justly or otherwise,
he was made the scapegoat.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Ideas About the Ministry.</p>


<p>To construct from the published deliverances, and
personal correspondence of Elias Hicks, a statement of his
theory and practice touching the ministry is desirable if not
easy. That he considered public religious exercise an exalted
function, if of the right sort, and emanating from the
Divine source, is abundantly evidenced in all he said and
wrote. The call to particular and general service, whether
in his home meeting for worship, or in connection with his
extended religious journeys, he believed came directly from
the Divine Spirit.</p>

<p>One instance is related, which possibly as clearly as
anything, illustrates his feeling regarding the ministry, and
the relationship of the Infinite to the minister. In the fall
of 1781, when his service in the ministry had been acknowledged
about three years, he was very ill with a fever,
which lasted for several months. In the most severe period
of this indisposition he tells us that "a prospect opened to
my mind to pay a religious visit to some parts of our island
where no Friends lived, and among a people, who, from
acquaintance I had with them, were more likely to mock
than receive me." He opposed the call, and argued against
it, only to see the disease daily reducing his bodily and mental
strength. He became convinced that in yielding to this
call lay his only hope of recovery, and had he not done so
his life would have gone out. Having fully recovered, the
intimated service was performed the following summer.</p>

<p>He seemed to treat his ministry as something in a
measure apart from his personality. He repeatedly referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
to his own ministerial labors in a way not unlike that indulged
in by his most ardent admirers. Yet this was always
accompanied with acknowledgment of the Divine enlightening
and assistance. On the 22d of Tenth month, 1779, he
held an appointed meeting in Hartford, Conn., a thousand
persons being present. Of this meeting he said: "The
Lord, in whom we trust, was graciously near, and furnished
us with ability to conduct the meeting to the satisfaction
and peace of our own minds; and to the edification of many
present, and general satisfaction to the assembly."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> Journal, p. 85.</p></div>

<p>Speaking of a meeting at Market Street, Philadelphia,
in Fourth month, 1801, he remarked: "My spirit was set
at liberty, and ability afforded to divide the word among
them, according to their varied conditions, in a large, searching
and effectual testimony; whereby a holy solemnity was
witnessed to spread over the meeting, to the great rejoicing
of the honest-hearted."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> Journal, p. 89.</p></div>

<p>At a meeting at Goose Creek, Virginia, the 22d of
Third month, 1797, he tells us: "After a considerable time
of silent labor, in deep baptism with the suffering seed, my
mouth was opened in a clear, full testimony, directed to
the states of those present. And many were brought under
the influence of that power which 'cut Rahab, and wounded
the dragon.'"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Journal, p. 69.</p></div>

<p>In the acknowledgment of the Divine influence and
favor, Elias Hicks had a collection of phrases which he
repeatedly used. "It was the Lord's doings, and marvelous
in our eyes," was a common expression. He repeatedly
said: "Our sufficiency was not of ourselves, but of God;
and that the Lord was our strength from day to day, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
is over all blessed forever." One of his favorite expressions
was: "To the Lord be all the praise, nothing due
to man."</p>

<p>Trite and pointed Scripture quotations were always at
command, and they were effectively employed, both in
speaking and writing. It will be noted by the reader that
not a few of the expressions used by Elias Hicks sound
like the phrases coined by George Fox.</p>

<p>That Elias Hicks believed in the plenary inspiration of
the preacher is well attested. His testimony was constantly
against the "letter," with little recognition that the letter
could ever contain the spirit. Here is a sample exhortation
to ministers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And it is a great thing when ministers keep in remembrance
that necessary caution of the divine Master, not
to premediate what they shall say; but carefully to wait
in the nothingness and emptiness of self, that what they
speak may be only what the Holy Spirit speaketh in them;
then will they not only speak the truth, but the truth, accompanied
with power, and thereby profit the hearers."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> Journal, p. 296.</p></div>

<p>He admonished Friends in meeting, and especially
ministers, to "get inward, and wait in their proper gifts."
The evident theory was that by waiting, and possibly wrestling
with the manifestation it was possible to tell whether
it was from below or above.</p>

<p>Still, there was not an entire absence of the human
and even the rational in Elias Hicks' theory of the ministry
as it worked out in practice. He had evidently discovered
the psychological side of public speaking to the
extent of recognizing that even the preacher was influenced
by his audience.</p>

<p>When he was in Philadelphia in 1816, before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
troubled times had arrived, he tells us that "it proved a
hard trying season: one of them [ministers] was exercised
in public testimony, and although she appeared to labor fervently,
yet but little life was felt to arise during the meeting.
This makes the work hard for the poor exercised ministers,
who feel the necessity publicly to advocate the cause of truth
and righteousness, and yet obtain but little relief, by reason
of the deadness and indifference of those to whom they are
constrained to minister. I found it my place to sit silent
and suffer with the seed."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Journal, p. 271.</p></div>

<p>In a personal letter, while on one of his visits, Elias
Hicks gave the following impression of the meeting and the
ministry:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To-day was the quarterly meeting of discipline. It
was large, and I think in the main a favored instructive
season, although considerably hurt by a pretty long, tedious
communication, not sufficiently clothed with life to make
it either comfortable or useful. So it is, the Society is in
such a mixed and unstable state, and many who presume
to be teachers in it, are so far from keeping on the original
foundation, the light and spirit of truth, and so built up in
mere tradition, that I fear a very great portion of the
ministry among us, is doing more harm than good, and
leading back to the weak and beggarly elements, to which
they seem desirous to be again in bondage."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> Letter to his wife, dated Purchase, N. Y., Tenth month 29, 1823.</p></div>

<p>This is not the only case of his measuring the general
effect of the ministry. In Seventh month, 1815, he attended
Westbury Quarterly Meeting, and of its experiences he
wrote as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Was the parting meeting held for public worship. It
was a large crowded meeting, but was somewhat hurt in
the forepart, by the appearance of one young in the ministry
standing too long, and manifesting too much animation:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
Yet, I believed, he was under the preparing hand, fitting
for service in the Church, if he only keeps low and humble,
and does not aspire above his gift, into the animation of the
creature. For there is great danger, if such are not deeply
watchful, of the transformer getting in and raising the mind
into too much creaturely zeal, and warmth of the animal
spirit, whereby they may be deceived, and attribute that
to the divine power, which only arises from a heated imagination,
and the natural warmth of their own spirits; and
so mar the work of the divine spirit on their minds, run
before their gift and lose it, or have it taken away from
them. They thereby fall into the condition of some formerly,
as mentioned by the prophet, who, in their creaturely
zeal, kindle a fire of their own, and walk in the light
thereof; but these, in the end, have to lie down in sorrow."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> Journal, p. 234.</p></div>

<p>Of the same quarterly meeting, held in Fourth month
in the following year, in New York, Elias wrote: "It was
for the most part a favored season, but would have been
more so, had not some in the ministry quite exceeded the
mark by unnecessary communication. For very great care
ought to rest on the minds of ministers, lest they become
burthensome, and take away the life from the meeting, and
bring over it a gloom of death and darkness, that may be
sensibly felt."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_44_44" id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> Journal, p. 268.</p></div>

<p>His feeling regarding his own particular labor in the
ministry is almost pathetically expressed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Meetings are generally large and well-attended, although
in the midst of harvest. I have continual cause for
deep humility and thankfulness of heart under a daily sense
of the continued mercy of the Shepherd of Israel, who when
he puts his servants forth, goes before them, and points out
the way, when to them all seems shut up in darkness.
This has been abundantly my lot from day to day, insomuch
that the saying of the prophet has been verified in my experience,
that none are so blind as the Lord's servants, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span>
deaf as his messengers. As generally when I first enter
meetings I feel like one, both dumb and deaf, and see nothing
but my own impotence. Nevertheless as my whole
trust and confidence is in the never-failing arm of divine
sufficiency, although I am thus emptied, I am not cast
down, neither has a murmuring thought been permitted to
enter, but in faith and patience, have had to inherit the
promise, as made to Israel formerly by the prophet. 'I will
never leave thee, nor forsake thee.' This my dear, I trust
will be the happy lot of all those who sincerely trust in the
Lord, and do not cast away their confidence, nor lean to
their own understanding."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_45_45" id="Footnote_45_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> Letter to his wife, written from East Caln, Pa., Seventh month
22, 1813.</p></div>

<p>Occasionally in his ministry Elias Hicks did what in
our time would be called sensational things. In this matter
he shall be his own witness. Fourth-day, the 6th of
Twelfth month, 1815, at Pearl Street meeting in New York,
there was a marriage during the meeting, on which account
the attendance was large. After remarking that his mind
was "exercised in an unusual manner," he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"For the subject which first presented, after my mind
had become silenced, was the remembrance of the manner
in which the temporal courts among men are called to
order; and it became so impressive, as to apprehend it
right to make use of it as a simile, much in the way the
prophet was led to make use of some of the Rechabites, to
convict Israel of their disobedience and want of attention to
their law and law-giver. I accordingly was led to cry
audibly three times, 'O yes! O yes! O yes! silence all persons,
under the pain and penalty of the displeasure of the
court.' This unusual address had a powerful tendency to
arrest the attention of all present, and from which I took
occasion, as truth opened the way, to reason with the assembly,
that if such a confused mass of people as are
generally collected together on such occasions, and from
very different motives, and many from mere curiosity to
hear and see the transactions of the court, should all in
an instant so honor and respect the court, as immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
to be still and silent at the simple call of the crier: How
much more reasonable is it, for a collection of people,
promiscuously gathered to the place appointed in a religious
way, to wait upon, and worship the Judge of heaven and
earth, to be still, and strive to silence every selfish and
creaturely thought and cogitation of the mind. For such
thoughts and cogitations would as certainly prevent our
hearing the inward divine voice of the King of heaven, and
as effectually hinder our worshipping him in spirit and in
truth, as the talking of the multitude at a court of moral
law, would interrupt the business thereof. As I proceeded
with this simile, the subject enlarged and spread, accompanied
with gospel power and the evident demonstration of
the spirit, whereby truth was raised into victory, and ran
as oil over all. The meeting closed with solemn supplication
and thanksgiving to the Lord our gracious Helper, to
whom all the honor and glory belong, both now and forever."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whatever may have been the opinion of Elias Hicks
as to the inspiration of the minister, he evidently did not
consider that it was so impersonal and accidental, or so
entirely outside the preacher, as to demand no care on his
own part. The following advisory statement almost provides
for what might be called "preparation:"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In those large meetings, where Friends are collected
from various parts, the weak and the strong together, and
especially in those for worship, it is essentially necessary
that Friends get inward, and wait in their proper gifts,
keeping in view their standing and place in society, especially
those in the ministry. For otherwise there is danger
even from a desire to do good, of being caught with the
enemies' transformations, particularly with those that are
young, and inexperienced; for we seldom sit in meetings but
some prospect presents, which has a likeness, in its first
impression, to the right thing; and as these feel naturally
fearful of speaking in large meetings, and in the presence
of their elderly friends, and apprehending they are likely to
have something to offer, they are suddenly struck with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
fear of man, and thereby prevented from centering down
to their gifts, so as to discover whether it is a right motion
or not; and the accuser of the brethren, who is always
ready with his transformations to deceive, charges with
unfaithfulness and disobedience, by which they are driven
to act without any clear prospect, and find little to say, except
making an apology for them thus standing; by which
they often disturb the meeting, and prevent others, who
are rightly called to the work, and thereby wound the
minds of the living baptized members."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The responsibility which Elias Hicks felt for the meeting
of which he was a member, and in which he felt called
to minister, is well illustrated in the following quotation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was under considerable bodily indisposition most
of this week. On Fifth-day, so much so, as almost to give
up the prospect of getting to meeting; but I put on my
usual resolution and went, and was glad in so doing, as
there I met with that peace of God that passeth all understanding,
which is only known by being felt. I had to declare
to my friends how good it is to trust in the Lord with
all the heart, and lean not to our own understandings, lest
they fail us."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> Journal, p. 230.</p></div>

<p>This records no uncommon occurrence. He was often
indisposed, but the illness had to be severe if it kept him
away from meeting.</p>

<p>During his later life he was frequently indisposed, and
sometimes under such bodily pain when speaking that he
was forced to stop in the midst of a discourse. This
happened in Green Street Meeting House, Philadelphia,
Eleventh month 12, 1826. On this occasion the stenographer
says that after "leaving his place for a few minutes,
he resumed." During this particular sermon Elias sat down
twice, beside the time mentioned, evidently to recover physical
strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>Elias Hicks was not one of those ministers who always
spoke if he attended meeting. Many times he was silent;
this being especially true when in his home meeting.
When on a religious visit he generally spoke, but not always.
That his <span class="correction" title="Originally: willingess">willingness</span> to "famish the people from words,"
tended to his local popularity, is quite certain.</p>

<p>The printed sermons of Elias Hicks would indicate that
at times he was quite lengthy, and seldom preached what is
known now as a short, ten-minute sermon. Estimating a
number of sermons, we find that they averaged about 6500
words, so that his sermons must have generally occupied
from thirty to forty-five minutes in delivery. Occasionally
a sermon contained over 8000 words, while sometimes less
than 4000 words.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Home at Jericho.</p>


<p>The village of Jericho, Long Island, is about 25 miles
east of New York City, in the town of Oyster Bay. It
has had no considerable growth since the days of Elias
Hicks, and now contains only about a score and a half of
houses. Hicksville, less than two miles away, the railroad
station for the older hamlet, contains a population of a
couple of thousand. It was named for Valentine Hicks,
the son-in-law of Elias.</p>

<p>Running through Jericho is the main-traveled road from
the eastern part of Long Island to New York, called Jericho
Pike. In our time it is a famous thoroughfare for automobiles,
is thoroughly modern, and as smooth and hard as
a barn floor. In former days it was a toll-road, and over
it Elias Hicks often traveled. A cross-country road runs
through Jericho nearly north and south, leading to Oyster
Bay. On this road, a few rods to the north from the turn
in the Jericho Pike stands the house which was originally
the Seaman homestead, where Elias Hicks lived from soon
after his marriage till his death.</p>

<p>The house was large and commodious for its time, but
has been remodeled, so that only part of the building now
standing is as it was eighty years ago. The house ends to
the road, with entrance from the south side. It was of the
popular Long Island and New England construction, shingled
from <span class="correction" title="Originally: celler">cellar</span> wall to ridge-pole. Four rooms on the east
end of the house, two upstairs and two down, are practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
as they were in the days of Elias Hicks. In one of these he
had his paralytic stroke, and in another he passed away.
The comparatively wide hall which runs across the house,
with the exception of the stairway, is as it was in the time
of its distinguished occupant. A new stairway of modern
construction now occupies the opposite side of the hall from
the one of the older time. This hall-way, it is said, Elias
Hicks loved to promenade, sometimes with his visitors, and
here with characteristic warmth of feeling he sped his
parting guests, when the time for their departure came.</p>

<p>Like the most of his neighbors, Elias Hicks was a
farmer. The home place probably contained about seventy-five
acres, but he possessed detached pieces of land, part of it
in timber. Several years before his death he sold forty
acres of the farm to his son-in-law, Valentine Hicks, thus
considerably reducing the care which advancing years and
increased religious labor made advisable.</p>

<p>Jericho still retains its agricultural character more than
some of the other sections of neighboring Long Island.
The multi-millionaire and the real estate exploiter have absorbed
many of the old Friendly homes toward the Westbury
neighborhood, and are pushing their ambitious intent at
land-grabbing down the Jericho road.</p>

<p>If Elias were to return and make a visit from Jericho
to the meeting at Westbury, as he often did in his time,
three or four miles away, he would pass more whizzing
automobiles en route than he would teams, and would see
the landscape beautifully adorned with lawns and walks,
with parks and drives on the hillsides, not to mention the
costly Roman garden of one of Pittsburg's captains of industry.
Should he so elect, he could be whirled in a
gasoline car in a few minutes over a distance which it
probably took him the better part of an hour to make in
his day. As he went along he could muse over snatches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
Goldsmiths' "Deserted Village," like the following, which
would be approximately, if not literally, true:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Hoards, e'en beyond the miser's wish abound,</div>
<div class="verse">And rich men flock from all the world around.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet count our gains: this wealth is but a name</div>
<div class="verse">That leaves our useful products just the same.</div>
<div class="verse">And so the loss: the man of wealth and pride</div>
<div class="verse">Takes up the place that many poor supplied;</div>
<div class="verse">Space for his lake, his parks extending bounds,</div>
<div class="verse">Space for his horses, equipage and hounds,</div>
<div class="verse">The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth,</div>
<div class="verse">Has robbed the neighboring fields of half their growth."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But there are some compensations in the modern scene,
and however emotionally sad the change, the helpfully suggestive
side is not in lamentation over the inevitable, but in
considering the growing demands which the situation makes
upon the practical spiritual religion which Elias Hicks
preached, and in which his successors still profess to believe.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago, wheat was a regular and staple
farm product on Long Island, especially in and around
Jericho, and on the Hicks farm. But no wheat is raised
in this section now. The farmer finds it more profitable
to raise the more perishable vegetables to feed the hungry
hordes of the great city, which has crowded itself nearer and
nearer to the farmers' domain.</p>

<p>Less than a quarter of a mile up the road from the
Hicks home is the Friends' Meeting House, which Elias
Hicks helped to build, if he did not design it. The timbers
and rafters, which were large, and are still sound to the
core, were hewed by hand of course. Like most of the
neighboring buildings, its sides were shingled, and probably
the original shingles have not been replaced since the house
was built, a hundred and twenty-two years ago. The "public
gallery" contained benches sloping steeply one above the
other, making the view of the preacher's gallery easy from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
these elevated positions. Over the preacher's gallery, and
facing the one just described, is room for a row of seats
behind a railing. Whether this was a sort of a "watch-tower"
from which the elders might observe the deportment
of the young people in the seats opposite, or whether it was
simply used for overflow purposes, tradition does not tell
us.</p>

<p>The fact probably is that what is known as the Hicks
property at Jericho came to Elias by his wife Jemima.
There is every reason to believe that at the time of his
marriage he was a poor man, and as the young folks took
up their residence at the Seaman home soon after their
marriage, there was no time for an accumulation of property
on the part of the head of the new family. The
economic situation involved in the matter under consideration
had a most important bearing on the religious service
of Elias Hicks. Taking the Seaman farm brought him
economic certainty, if not independence. It is hardly conceivable
that he could have given the large attention to the
"free gospel ministry" which he did, had there been a
struggle with debt and difficulty which was so incidental in
laying the foundations of even a moderate success a century
and a quarter ago. It is by no means to be inferred, however,
that Elias Hicks was ever a wealthy man, or possessed
the means of luxury, for which of course he had no desire,
and against which he bore a life-long testimony. The real
point to be gratefully remembered is that he was not overburdened
with the care and worry which a less desirable
economic condition would have enforced.</p>

<p>In the main, Elias Hicks saw his married children settle
around him. Royal Aldrich, who married his oldest
daughter, had a tannery, and lived on the opposite side of
the road not far away. Valentine Hicks, who married
another daughter, had a somewhat pretentious house for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
the time, at the foot of the little hill approaching the meeting
house, and just beyond the house of Elias, Robert Seaman,
who married the youngest daughter, lived only a few
steps away. Joshua Willets, who married the third
daughter, resided on the south side of the island, some miles
distant. The time of scattering families, lured by business
outlook and economic advantage, had not yet arrived.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Hicks Family.</p>


<p>In the home at Jericho the children of Elias Hicks
were born. Touching his family we have this bit of interesting
information from Elias Hicks himself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My wife, although not of a very strong constitution,
lived to be the mother of eleven children, four sons and
seven daughters. Our second daughter, a very lovely
promising child, died when young with the small pox, and
the youngest was not living at its birth. The rest all
arrived to years of discretion, and afforded us considerable
comfort, as they proved to be in a good degree dutiful
children. All our sons, however, were of weak constitutions,
and were not able to take care of themselves, being
so enfeebled as not to be able to walk after the ninth year
of their age. The two eldest died in the fifteenth year of
their age, the third in his seventeenth year, and the youngest
was nearly nineteen when he died. But, although thus
helpless, the innocency of their lives, and the resigned
cheerfulness of their dispositions to their allotments, made
the labour and toil of taking care of them agreeable and
pleasant; and I trust we were preserved from murmuring
or repining, believing the dispensation to be in wisdom, and
according to the will and gracious disposing of an all-wise
providence, for purposes best known to himself. And when
I have observed the great anxiety and affliction, which many
parents have with undutiful children who are favoured
with health, especially their sons, I could perceive very
few whose troubles and exercises, on that account, did not
far exceed ours. The weakness and bodily infirmity of our
sons tended to keep them much out of the way of the
troubles and temptations of the world; and we believed
that in their death they were happy, and admitted into the
realms of peace and joy; a reflection, the most comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>
and joyous that parents can have in regard to their tender
offspring."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> Journal, p. 14.</p></div>

<p>The children thus referred to by their father were
the following: Martha, born in 1771. She married Royal
Aldrich, and died in 1862, at the advanced age of ninety-one.
She was a widow for about twenty years.</p>

<p>David was born in 1773, and died in 1787. Elias,
the second son, was born in 1774, and died the same year
as his brother David. Elizabeth was born in 1777, and
died in 1779. This is the daughter who had the small
pox. There are no records telling whether the other members
of the family had the disease, or how this child of two
years became a victim of the contagion.</p>

<p>Phebe, the third daughter, was born in 1779. She
married Joshua Willets, as noted in the last chapter.</p>

<p>Abigail, who married Valentine Hicks, a nephew of
Elias, was born in 1782. She died Second month 26, 1850,
while her husband passed away the 5th of Third month of
the same year, just one week after the death of his wife.</p>

<p>Jonathan, the third son, was born in 1784, and passed
away in 1802. His brother, John, was born in 1789, and
died in 1805.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, evidently named for her little sister, was
born in 1791, and lived to a good old age. She passed
away in <span class="correction" title="Originally: 1781">1871</span>. She was never married, and occasionally
accompanied her father on his religious visits. She was
known in the neighborhood, in her later years at least, as
"Aunt Elizabeth," and is the best-remembered of any of
the children of Elias Hicks. As the Friends remember her
she was a spare woman, never weighing over ninety pounds.</p>

<p>The youngest child of the family, Sarah, was born in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>
1793. She married Robert Seaman, her kinsman, and died
in 1835. Robert, her husband, died in 1860.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the home at Jericho was a house
acquainted with grief. Of the ten children, Martha, David,
Elias and little Elizabeth made up the juvenile members of
the household, up to the time of the death of the latter.
Phebe came the same year, while Abigail was born three
years later, so that there were at least four or five children
always gathered around the family board. Before the passing
away of Elias and David, the family had been increased
by the birth of Jonathan, making the children living at one
time six. After the death of the three older boys, and the
birth of Elizabeth and Sarah, until the death of John in
1805, living children were still six in number. The
five daughters, Martha, Phebe, Abigail, Elizabeth and Sarah
all outlived their parents.</p>

<p>Elias Hicks was undoubtedly a most affectionate father,
as the letters to his wife and children show. How much
this was diluted by the apparent sternness of his religious
concerns is a matter for the imagination to determine.
What were the amusements of this large family is an interesting
question in this "age of the child," with its surfeit
of toys and games. What were the tasks of the girls it is
not so hard to answer. Of course they worked "samplers,"
pieced quilts, learned to spin and knit, and possibly to weave,
and to prepare the wool or flax for the loom. If we read
between the lines in the description of their father, we can
easily infer that the physically afflicted sons were nevertheless
not without the joys of boyhood.</p>

<p>At all events, if it was an afflicted family, it was also
a united one. It was a home where the parents were reverenced
by the children, and where there was a feeling of
love, and a sense of loyalty. This feeling is still character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>istic
of the descendants of Elias Hicks. It is a sample of
the persistence of the qualities of a strong man, in the generations
that come after him.</p>

<p>Of the four daughters of Elias Hicks who were
married, but two had children, so that the lineal descendants
of the celebrated Jericho preacher are either descendants of
Martha Hicks, wife of Valentine, or of Sarah Hicks Seaman.
These two branches of the family are quite
numerous.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_50_50" id="Footnote_50_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> The descendants referred to will be given in their proper place
in the Appendix.</p></div>

<p>Of Jemima, the wife of Elias Hicks, little is known
apart from the correspondence of her husband, and that is
considerable. That he considered her his real help-meet,
and had for her a lover's affection to the end is abundantly
attested by all of the facts. Dame Rumor, in the region of
Jericho, claims that she was her husband's intellectual inferior,
but that is an indefinite comparison worth very little.
That she was at some points his superior is undoubtedly
true, and it must be remembered that Elias himself, with all
of his great natural ability, lacked intellectual culture and
literary training. Jemima was evidently a good housekeeper,
and manager of affairs. Before she had sons-in-law
with whom to advise, and even after that, the business
side of the family was a considerable part of the time in her
hands. It is no small matter to throw upon a woman,
never robust, the responsibility of both the mother and
father of a family during the prolonged absence of the
husband.</p>

<p>The first long religious visit of Elias Hicks lasted ten
weeks. At that time there were four little people in the
Hicks home, from eight-year-old Martha to two-year-old
Elizabeth, who died that year, while Phebe was born after
the return of her father from his Philadelphia trip. Sev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>eral
of the other extended journeys were made while the
children of the family were of an age requiring care. Of
course this laid labor and responsibility on the wife and
mother. These she bore without complaining and, we may
be sure, with executive ability of no mean order.</p>

<p>It was a time when women were not expected to be
either the intellectual peers or companions of their husbands,
and we cannot justly apply the measurements and standards
of to-day, to the women of a century ago. Men of the
Elias Hicks type, meeting their fellows in public assemblies
and ministering to them, traveling widely and forming
many friendships, whether in the Society of Friends or out
of it, are likely to be praised, if not petted, while their
wives, less known, labor on unappreciated. Such a woman
was Jemima Hicks. To her, and all like her, the lasting
gratitude of the sons of men is due.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Letters to his Wife.</p>


<p>In the long absences from home, which the religious
visits of Elias Hicks involved, as a matter of course many
of the domestic burdens fell heavily upon his wife. In so
far as he could atone for his absence by sending epistles
home he did so. In fact, for the times, he was a voluminous
letter writer.</p>

<p>It was not a time of rapid transit. Distances now
spanned in a few hours demanded days and weeks when
Elias Hicks was active in the ministry. At the best, but
a few letters could reach home from the traveler absent for
several months.</p>

<p>In the main the letters which Elias sent to his beloved
Jemima were of the ardent lover-like sort. It seemed impossible,
however, for him to avoid the preacherly function
in even his most tender and domestic missives. Exhortations
to practical righteousness, and to the maintenance of
what he considered the Friendly fundamentals, were plentifully
mixed with his most private and personal concerns.</p>

<p>In going over this correspondence one wishes for more
<span class="correction" title="Originally: discription">description</span>, relating to the human side of the traveler's
experiences. A man who several times traversed what was
really the width of habitable America, and mostly either in
a wagon or on horseback, must have seen much that was
interesting, and many times humorous and even pathetic.
But few of these things moved Elias Hicks, or diverted him
from what he considered the purely gospel character of his
mission.</p>

<p>Still there is much worth while in this domestic corre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>spondence.
From it we compile and annotate such extracts
as seem to help reveal the character of the man who wrote
them.</p>

<p>On the 13th of Eighth month, 1788, Elias was at Creek,
now Clinton Corners, in Dutchess county, New York. From
a letter written to his wife that day, we quote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My heart glows at this time with much love and affection
for thee and our dear children, with breathing desires
for your preservation, and that thou, my dear, may be kept
in a state of due watchfulness over thyself, and those dear
lambs under thy care, that nothing may interrupt the current
of pure love among you in my absence."</p></blockquote>

<p>A letter dated "Lynn, Massachusetts, ye 24th of Eighth
month, 1793," and written to his wife, is of peculiar interest.
We quote the first sentences:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I received last evening, at my return to this place from
the East, thy very acceptable letter of the 16th instant....
The contents, except the account of the pain in thy
side, were truly comfortable. That part wherein thou expresseth
a resignation to the Divine Will, was particularly
satisfactory, for in this, my dear, consists our chiefest happiness
and consolation."</p></blockquote>

<p>He sometimes expressed a sense of loneliness in his
travels, but was certain of the nearness of the Divine Spirit.
In the letter mentioned above he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thou hast cause to believe with me, my dear, that it
was He that first united our hearts together in the bonds of
an endeared love and affection. So it is He that has kept
and preserved us all our life long, and hath caused us to
witness an increase of that unfading love, which as thou
expresseth is ever new."</p></blockquote>

<p>Evidently his beloved Jemima, like Martha of old, was
unduly troubled about many things, for we find Elias in his
letter indulging in the following warning: "And let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
again hint to thee a care over thyself, for I fear thou wilt
expose thyself by too much bodily exercise in the care of thy
business."</p>

<p>It is seldom that we find even a tinge of complaining in
any of his letters. It seems, however, that his women folks
were not industrious correspondents. In closing the letter
noted he thus expressed himself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My companion receives his packet of letters, frequently
four, five or six at a time, which makes me feel as if I was
forgotten by my friends, having received but two small
letters from home since I left you. And thou writest, my
dear, as if paper was scarce, on very small pieces."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 3d of Ninth month, of the same year, a letter
was written to his wife, much like the foregoing. It is
interesting to note that Elias was at this time the guest of
Moses Brown (in Providence), the founder of the Moses
Brown School. The small pieces of paper mentioned are
hints of a wifely economy, not altogether approved by her
very economical husband. There is a gentle tinge of rebuke
in the following, written from Nine Partners, Eleventh
month 19, 1818. The temptation is strong to read into
these lines, a grain of humor touching the much-talked-of
persistence of a woman's will:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Inasmuch as I have often felt concerned when thus
absent, least thou should worry thyself, with too much care
and labor in regard to our temporal concerns, and have
often desired thee to be careful in that respect, but mostly
without effect, by reason that thou art so choice of thy own
free agency as to be afraid to take the advice of thy best
friend, lest it might mar that great privilege; I therefore
now propose to leave thee at full liberty to use it in thine
own pleasure with the addition of this desire, that thou use
it in that way as will produce to thee the most true comfort
and joy, and then I trust I shall be comforted, my
dear, in thy comfort, and joyful in thy joy."</p></blockquote>

<p>A letter dated West Jersey, near Salem, the 6th of First<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
month, 1798, mentions a singular concern about apparel. He
exhorts his wife to guard the tender minds of their children
from "foolish and worldly vanities," and then drops into a
personal and general statement regarding what he considered
simplicity and plainness as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Great is the apparent departure from primitive purity
and plainness among many professors of the truth, where
our lots have been cast. Foreseeing that I may often be
led in a line of close doctrine to such it has brought me
under close self-examination, knowing for certain that those
who have to deal out to others ought to look well to their
own going. In this time of scrutiny nothing turned up as
bringing reproof to my mind concerning our children, but
the manner of wearing their gown sleeves long and pinned
at the wrist. This I found to strike at the pure life, and
wounded my mind. I clearly saw my deficiency that I had
not more endeavored to have it done away with before I
left home, for I felt it as a burden then. But seeing our
dear daughters had manifested so much condescension in
other things, and this being like one of the least, I endeavored
to be easy under it. But feeling it with assurance
not to be a plant of our Heavenly Father's right-hand planting,
think it ought to be plucked up. Let our dear
daughters read these lines, and tell them their dear father
prays they may wisely consider the matter, and if they can
be willing so far to condescend to my desire while absent
as to have these things removed, it will be as balsam to my
wounded spirit, and they will not go without their reward.
But their father's God will bless them and become their
God, as they are faithful to his reproofs in their hearts,
and walk fearfully before Him. He will redeem them, out
of all adversity to the praise and glory of His grace, who
is over all, God, blessed forever."</p></blockquote>

<p>During a visit to Nine Partners, Twelfth month 15,
1803, Elias wrote to Jemima. Evidently she had repelled
the inference, if not the implication, that she had been negligent
in her correspondence, for we find the letter in question
beginning in this fashion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Although I wrote thee pretty fully last evening, yet
having since that received a precious, refreshing letter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
thee, by Isaac Frost (it being the first I have received from
thee since I left home), but finding from thy last that thou
hast written several. It affords a singular satisfaction in
finding thou hast been mindful of me. But I have not complained,
my dear, nor let in, nor indulged a thought that
thou hadst forgotten me, nor do I believe thou couldst.
There is nothing while we continue in our right minds that
can dissolve that firm and precious bond of love and endeared
affection, which from our first acquaintance united
us together, and in which, while writing these lines my
spirit greets thee with endeared embraces."</p></blockquote>

<p>It surely seems strange that a man who was the father
of eleven children, that his only source of personal "reproof"
concerning them, was this little matter of the sleeves and
the pins. This probably is a fair illustration of what may
be called the conservatism of Elias Hicks touching all of the
peculiarities of the Society of Friends.</p>

<p>The postscript to a letter written to Jemima from
Shrewsbury, New Jersey, Twelfth month 17, 1797, reads
as follows: "As thou writes but poorly, if thou should get
Hallet or Royal to write superscriptions on the letters, it
would make them more plain for conveyance."</p>

<p>It was only seldom that business affairs at home were
referred to in his epistles to his wife. But occasionally a
departure was made from this practice. Where these lapses
do occur, it would seem that they should be noted. In the
fall of 1822 Elias was in the vicinity of Philadelphia, and
was stopping with his friend and kinsman, Edward Hicks,
at Newtown, in Bucks county.</p>

<p>In this letter he says: "My health is much the same as
when I left home. I was disappointed in not meeting any
letters here, as I feel very anxious how you all do." We
copy the balance of the letter, with its tender admonition
to Jemima:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I will just remind thee that before I left home I
put two old ewes in the green rye on the plains. If they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
should improve as to be fit to kill, I should be willing thou
would let Josiah have one of them, as he agreed to split up
some of the timber that was blown down in the woods
by him, into rails and board himself. The other thou might
sell or otherwise at thy pleasure.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear, let me remind thee of thy increasing
bodily infirmities, and the necessity it lays thee under to
spare thyself of the burthen and care of much bodily and
mental labour and exercise, by which thou will experience
more quiet rest, both to body and mind, and that it may be,
my dear, our united care to endeavor that our last days
may be our best days, that so we may witness a state and
qualification to pass gently and quietly out of time, into
the mansions of eternal blessedness, where all sighing and
sorrow, will be at an end."</p></blockquote>

<p>While in Pennsylvania, and at what is now York,
Fourth month 3, 1798, he sent a tender missive home.
Part of it referred to business matters. He gave directions
for preparing the ground, and planting potatoes, and also
for oats and flax, the latter being a crop practically unknown
to present-day Long Island. He then gives the following
direction regarding a financial obligation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And as James Carhartt has a bond of sixty pounds
against me, of money belonging to a Dutchman, should be
glad if thou hast not money enough by thee to pay the
interest thereof, thou would call upon Royal or brother
Joseph and get some, and pay it the first of Fifth month."</p></blockquote>

<p>While at Rahway, New Jersey, Eleventh month 6,
1801, on his visit to Friends in New Jersey and Pennsylvania,
he wrote one of his most expressive letters to Jemima.
A postscript was attached directed to his daughters. To his
oldest daughter, Martha, he sent an exhortation in which
he said: "My desires for thee, my dear, are that thou may
be preserved innocent and chaste to the Lord, for I can have
no greater joy than to find my children walking in the
truth."</p>

<p>That a large part of his concern was for the comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
of his wife in the long absences from home is abundantly
shown in his entire correspondence. The last postscript to
the Rahway letter is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And, dear Phebe and Abigail, remember your Creator,
who made you not to spend your time in play and vanity,
but to be sober and to live in his fear, that he may bless
you. Be obedient to your dear mother, it is my charge to
you. Love and help her whatever you can; it will comfort
your dear father."</p></blockquote>

<p>The 2d of Eleventh month, 1820, Elias arrived at
Hudson, and learning that the steamboat to New York was
to pass that day, he prepared and sent a letter to his wife.
In this letter he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It may be that some of my friends may think me so
far worth noticing, as to meet me with a line or two at Nine
Partners, as I have often felt very desirous of hearing how
you fare at home, but this desire hath mostly failed of
being gratified. I suppose the many things so absorb the
minds of my friends at home, that they have no time to
think of so poor a thing as I am. But never mind it, as
all things, it is said, will work together for good to those
that love and fear [God]."</p></blockquote>

<p>While at Saratoga, in 1793, Elias wrote to Jemima,
Tenth month 15th. This is one of his most ardent epistles.
"Oh, my dear," he says, "may we ever keep in remembrance
the day of our espousal and gladness of our hearts, as I
believe it was a measure of the Divine Image that united our
hearts together in the beginning. It is the same that I believe
has, and still doth strengthen the sweet, influential and
reciprocal bond, that nothing, I trust, as we dwell under a
sense of Divine love and in the pure fear, will ever be able
to obliterate or deface."</p>

<p>Third month 15, 1798, a letter was written from
Alexandria, Va., from which we make this extract:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span></p><blockquote>

<p>"We came here this morning from Sandy Spring, which
is upwards of twenty miles distant. Got in timely so as
to attend their meeting which began at the tenth hour.
Crossed the river Potomac on our way. We got on horseback
about break of day, and not being very well I thought
I felt the most fatigued before I got in, I was ever sensible
of before. When I came to the meeting, a poor little one
it was, and wherein I had to suffer silence through the
meeting for worship, but in their Preparative which followed,
I found my way open in a measure to ease my mind."</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">The Slavery Question.</p>


<p>John Woolman was the mouth-piece of the best
Quaker conscience of the eighteenth century on the slavery
question. For twenty-five years before his death, in 1772,
he was pleading with the tenderness of a woman that his
beloved religious society should clear itself from complicity
with the system which held human beings in bondage. His
mantel apparently fell on Warner Mifflin, a young man residing
in Kent county, Delaware, near the little hamlet of
Camden. In 1775 Mifflin manumitted his slaves, and was
followed by like conduct on the part of his father, Daniel
Mifflin, a resident of Accomac County, in Virginia.</p>

<p>Warner Mifflin is said to have been the first man in
America to voluntarily give freedom to his bondmen, and
to make restitution to such of them as were past twenty-one,
for the unrequited service which they had rendered him.
Be that as it may, from 1775, until his death in 1799,
Warner Mifflin, with tireless zeal labored with Friends personally,
and with meetings in their official capacity, to drive
the last remnant of slavery from the Quaker fold. His
efforts appeared in various monthly meeting minutes
throughout Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, and he was not
backward in laying his concern before the Yearly Meeting
itself. In 1783, on the initiative of Mifflin, the Yearly Meeting
for Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the
Western Parts of Maryland and Virginia, memorialized
the infant United States Congress in regard to slavery.
The document was a striking one for the time, was signed
in person by 535 Friends, and was presented to the Congress
by a strong committee headed by Warner Mifflin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>These efforts at internal deliverance from connection
and complicity with slavery produced speedy results, and
before the close of the century not a Quaker slave holder
remained in the Society, unless in some obscure cases that
continued "under care." Having cleared its own skirts of
slavery, the members of the Society became divided into
two classes&mdash;the one anxious that the Quaker conscience
should make its appeal to the general conscience for the
entire abolition of the "great iniquity." The other class,
satisfied with their own sinlessness in this particular, wished
the Society to remain passive, and in no way mix with a
public agitation of the mooted question. These two opposing
views distracted the Society down to the very verge of
the final issue in the slaveholders' rebellion.</p>

<p>Elias Hicks was three years Warner Mifflin's junior.
He probably saw the Delaware abolitionist during his visits
to Philadelphia Yearly Meeting before the death of Mifflin.
Whether either ever saw or heard John Woolman cannot be
positively stated. Mifflin was twenty-seven when the great
New Jersey preacher and reformer passed away, and must
have fallen under the spell of Woolman's inspiring leadership.
Elias Hicks could hardly have escaped being influenced
by this "elder brother," although he may never have
seen him.</p>

<p>The subject of this biography was among those who
believed that the Society of Friends had a message to the
world along the line of its internal testimony against
slavery, and he did not hesitate to deliver the message,
though it disturbed the superficial ease in Zion. Still he
had no definite plan apart from the appeal to conscience for
settling the problem.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, however, that Elias Hicks
passed away before the real abolition movement, as represented
by Garrison and Phillips and their compeers, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
begun its vigorous agitation, or organized its widely applied
propaganda. What the attitude of Elias would have been
toward Friends becoming members of the abolition societies,
which after his death played such an important part,
and touching which many Friends were either in doubt or
in opposition we cannot even surmise.</p>

<p>Benjamin Lundy<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> commenced his literary warfare
against slavery, with the ponderously named "Genius of
Universal Emancipation," in 1821. Elias Hicks was one of
Lundy's most concerned and faithful patrons, in some of
his undertakings,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> as appears in his personal correspondence.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> Benjamin Lundy was born of Quaker parents, First month 4,
1789, in Sussex County, New Jersey. He learned the trade of harness
maker and saddler, and went to Ohio, where he became very much
interested in the slavery question. In 1816 he issued an "Address"
touching the evils of slavery. Of this Address, Horace <span class="correction" title="Originally: Greely">Greeley</span> says,
it contained the germ of the whole anti-slavery movement. In First
month, 1821, he issued the first number of <i>The Genius of Universal
Emancipation</i>. Lundy was interested in various schemes for colonization,
and assisted many emancipated negroes to go to Hayti, and contemplated
the establishment of a colony of colored people in Mexico.
He died at Lowell, Illinois, Eighth month 22, 1839, and was buried
in the Friends' burying ground at Clear Creek.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_52_52" id="Footnote_52_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> Please inform Benjamin Lundy that I have procured fifty-two
subscribers, or subscribers for fifty-two books, entitled, "Letters," etc.&mdash;Extract
from letter to his son-in-law, Valentine Hicks, dated Jericho,
Eleventh month 6, 1827.</p></div>

<p>The state of New York provided for the gradual emancipation
of its slaves in 1799, so that Elias Hicks had to go
away from home after that period to get into real slave territory.
As has been seen he began bearing his testimony in
meetings for worship against the institution in Maryland,
where slave holding was the law of the land until the end.</p>

<p>There are statements more or less legendary to the
effect that Elias was the owner of one slave, but of that
there is no authentic evidence, while the probabilities are all
against it. If he ever held a slave or slaves, he undoubtedly
manumitted them. An act of such importance would hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
have escaped record in the Journal, and no reference to it
exists.</p>

<p>The controversies and disownments in the Society of
Friends on account of the slavery question really came after
the death of Elias. The trouble in New York resulting
in the disownment of Isaac T. Hopper, James S. Gibbons
and Charles Marriott came on more than a decade after
his death. This entire controversy has been wrongly estimated
by most of the biographers and historians, representing
the pronounced abolitionists of the period. It was
not simply a contest between anti-slavery Friends and pro-slavery
Friends. In fact the moving spirits against Isaac
T. Hopper were not advocates or defenders of slavery as an
institution. George F. White, who was probably the head
and front of the movement to disown Isaac T. Hopper, was
not in favor of slavery. After his death his monthly meeting
memorialized him, and among other things stated that
he had for years refrained from using commodities made
by slave labor.</p>

<p>The conservative wing of the Society was opposed
to Friends becoming identified with any organization for
any purpose outside of the Society. George F. White
attacked temperance organizations, as he did abolition societies.</p>

<p>It was a common inference, if not a claim, of the Garrisonian
abolitionists, that there were no real anti-slavery
men outside of their organization. In Fifth month, 1840,
there was a debate involving the abolition attitude of the
Society of Friends in the town of Lynn, Massachusetts. In
this debate William Lloyd Garrison said of the Society: "If
it were an abolition society, its efforts would be identified
with ours."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span></p></div>

<p>In the same debate Oliver Johnson disputed the abolition
claims of the Society of Friends, saying: "They have
asserted for themselves the claim of being an abolition society.
But we never could get into their meeting house."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
Thus was the test of abolitionism made to hinge upon housing
the Abolition Society.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>That the attitude of the conservatives was ill-advised
and reprehensible may be true. It is also true that this
body of Friends were not in favor of any effort to overthrow
slavery by popular agitation. They held that all other
Christians should do what Friends had done, cease to hold
slaves, and that would settle the whole question. However
shortsighted this attitude may have been, very few, if any,
of the Friends holding it, believed in holding black men
in bondage. In fact it is pretty safe to assert that at no
time after the Society had freed itself from direct complicity
with slavery was there any considerable number of
strictly pro-slavery Friends in this country.</p>

<p>In the disownments in the Society growing out of the
slavery controversy there was never a direct charge of abolitionism
brought against the accused. In Kennett Monthly
Meeting in Chester County, Pa., where in about seven years
thirty-four Friends were disowned, the charge was that the
persons had "associated with others in forming, sustaining
and supporting a professedly religious organization<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> distinct
from and not owned by Friends, and have wholly declined
attending our religious meetings."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Of course, it is true that the Friends who took part
in the Progressive Friends' movement were probably led to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
do so because the way did not open for them to be aggressively
anti-slavery in the parent meeting.</p>

<p>The colonization scheme, that is a plan to colonize
emancipated negroes either in Africa, or in Hayti, or elsewhere,
was prominently urged during the time of Elias
Hicks. Benjamin Lundy had a plan of this character which
he attempted to make practical. Evan Lewis,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> of New
York, in 1820, was interested in an effort of this sort, and
sought the advice of Elias Hicks in the matter.</p>

<div class="footnote">

with King Henry, of San Domingo. Was a warm friend of
Elias Hicks, and after the "separation" wrote a pamphlet in defense
of Elias.</p></div>

<p>We have not been able to find any reply to this particular
letter, and are thus not warranted in saying whether
Elias Hicks sympathized with such a scheme or not.</p>

<p>The attitude of Elias Hicks on the slavery question is
only minutely referred to in his Journal. His private correspondence
gives his feeling and conduct in the case, in not
a few instances. From his general disposition one would
expect to find his objections to slavery based entirely on
moral and religious grounds. Still, evidence abounds that
he had also considered the economic phases of the question,
as note the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I may further add that from forty years of observation
that in all cases where opportunity has opened the way
fairly to contrast the subject, it has afforded indubitable
evidence to my mind, that free labor is cheaper and more
profitable than that done by slaves."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p></blockquote>

Eleventh month 2, 1822.</p></div>

<p>It seems to have been laid upon him to present the
claims of the truth as he saw it, in slave-holding communities.
He makes the following statement touching service of
this kind in Virginia:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span></p><blockquote>

<p>"I have passed through some proving seasons since I
left Baltimore, in meetings where many negro masters attended,
some of whom held fifty, some an hundred, and
some it was thought one hundred and fifty of these poor
people in slavery. Was led to treat on the subject in divers
meetings, in such a manner and so fully to expose the
iniquity and unrighteousness thereof, that some who had
stouted<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> it out hitherto against all conviction, were much
humbled and brought to a state of contrition, and not one
individual had power to make any opposition. But truth
reigned triumphantly over all, to the rejoicing of many
hearts."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> "Stouted" seems to have been a favorite word with Elias. He
habitually uses it as representing an aggravated resistance to the
truth.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_60_60" id="Footnote_60_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> From letter written to his wife from Alexandria, Va., Third
month 15, 1798.</p></div>

<p>Elias Hicks wrote a number of articles on the slavery
question, and some of them were printed and publicly circulated.
A letter written at Manchester, England, Seventh
month 5, 1812, by Martha Routh, and addressed to Elias
Hicks, says: "I have not forgot that I am debtor to thee
this way, for two very acceptable and instructive epistles, the
latter with a pamphlet setting forth the deep exercise of thy
mind, and endeavors for the more full relief of our fellow-brethren,
the African race." This letter informs Elias that
the author sent his pamphlet to Thomas Clarkson.</p>

<p>Considerable was written by Elias Hicks on the slave
trade, some of it existing as unpublished manuscript. An
article, filling four closely written pages of foolscap, is
among his literary effects. A very long letter was written
to James Cropper, of England, on the same subject. Both
of these documents were written while the slave-trade bill
was pending in the British Parliament. Elias considered the
measure entirely inadequate, holding that the domestic production
of slaves was as inhuman and abhorrent, if not more
so, as their importation from Africa. In the letter to
Cropper this strong statement is found: "It ought ever to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
be remembered that it is one of the most necessary and
essential duties both towards God and man, for individuals
and nations to exert all the power and influence they are
possessed of, in every righteous and consistent way, to put
an entire stop to all oppression, robbery and murder without
partiality, as it respects nations or individuals."</p>

<p>Many times, in his published sermons, Elias Hicks dealt
with the iniquity of slavery. Without doubt he expressed
himself in like manner in sermons preached before interest
in the man and his utterances caused his sermons to be
stenographically reported and published.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Oh! that our eyes might be opened, to see more deeply
into the mystery of iniquity and godliness; that we might
become conversant in godliness and so reject iniquity. For
all this wicked oppression of the African race is of the
mystery of iniquity. The man of sin and son of perdition
does these works, and nothing else does them. Justice is
fallen in the streets, and in the councils of the nation. How
much justice there is; for they have it in their power to do
justice to these poor oppressed creatures, but they are waiting
till all their selfish notions are gratified."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p></blockquote>

1826. The "Quaker," Vol. 4, p. 183.</p></div>

<p>Elias Hicks was as strongly opposed to the lines of
interest and economic conduct which indirectly supported
slavery as he was to the institution itself. We quote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And for want of a sight of this oppression, how many
there are who, though they seem not willing to put their
hands upon a fellow creature to bind him in chains of bondage,
yet they will do everything to help along by purchasing
the labor of those poor creatures, which is like eating flesh
and drinking blood of our poor fellow-creatures. Is it like
coming home to justice? For the thief and oppressor are
just alike; the one is as bad as the other."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span></p></div>

<p>In dealing with slavery and slaveholders, his language
often bordered on what would now be called bitterness.
Here is a case in point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Can slaveholders, mercenaries and hirelings, who look
for their gain from this quarter, can they promote the religion
of Jesus Christ? No, they are the cause of its reproach,
for they are the cause of making unbelievers."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p></blockquote>

and Edward Parker, p. 24.</p></div>

<p>His concern touching slavery was largely based on considerations
of justice, and regard for the opportunity which
he believed ought to be the right of all men. In one of his
sermons he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thousands and tens of thousands have been forbidden
the enjoyment of every good thing on earth, even of common
school-learning; and must it still be so? God forbid it.
But this would be a trifle, if they had the privilege of
rational beings on the earth; that liberty which is the greatest
of all blessings&mdash;the exercise of free agency. And here
we are glutting ourselves with the toils of their labor!...
But this noble testimony, of refusing to partake of the spoils
of oppression, lies with the dearly beloved young people of
this day. We can look for but little from the aged, who have
been accustomed to these things."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the sermon "just referred to," we find the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We are on a level with all the rest of God's creatures.
We are not better for being white than others for being
black; and we have no more right to oppress the blacks
because they are black than they have to oppress us because
we are white. Therefore, every one who oppresses
his colored brother or sister is a tyrant upon the earth; and
every one who strengthens the hand of an oppressor is a
tyrant upon earth. They have turned from God, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>

<p>Of the "essays" on the slavery question written by
Elias Hicks, one has survived, and is bound in the volume,
"Letters of Elias Hicks." The pamphlet in question, though
small, like many "ancient" productions, had a very large
title, viz.: "Observations on the Slavery of the Africans
and Their Descendants, and the Use of the Produce of Their
Labor."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> It was originally published in 1811, having been
approved by the Meeting for Sufferings of New York
Yearly Meeting. Nearly half of the "essay" is made up of
a series of questions and answers. When printed it made
six leaves the size of this page. On the subject of the
product of slave labor, decided ground was taken, the claim
being that all such produce was "prize goods." The reason
for this claim was that the slaves originally were captives,
practically the victims of a war of capture if not conquest.
Among other things the essay argues the rightfulness and
justice of any State to pass laws abolishing slavery within
its borders.</p>

<p>While the arguments presented in this document are of
general value, it is probable that the pamphlet was in the
main intended for circulation among Friends, with a view
to stimulating them to such action as would forward the
cause of freedom. This essay by Elias Hicks antedated by
five years the address by Benjamin Lundy, already referred
to, and was probably one of the first publications in the
nineteenth century actually advocating the abolition of
slavery.</p>

<p>In studying the slavery question it is necessary to re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>member
that before the invention of the cotton gin, about
1793, a considerable but unorganized and ineffective anti-slavery
sentiment existed in the country. But after that
invention, which rendered slave labor very remunerative,
sentiment of this sort subsided so that the Friends, who, like
Elias Hicks, advocated abolition during the first quarter of
the nineteenth century, were really pioneers in the attempt
which resulted in the freedom of a race.</p>

<p>At one time church organizations, even in the South,
especially the Baptists, passed resolutions favorable to the
abolition of slavery. Churches North and South in the
decade between 1780 and 1790 were well abreast of Friends
in this particular. Touching this matter Horace Greeley
remarked: "But no similar declaration has been made by
any Southern Baptist Convention since field-hands rose to
$1,000 each, and black infants at birth were accounted worth
$100."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>We could make copious extracts from the anti-slavery
utterances of Elias Hicks, but our object is simply to give
the scope of his thinking and purpose in regard to this
matter. Few men at certain points were more altruistic
than he, and as an altruist he could not do other than oppose
the great social and economic iniquity of his time. From his
standpoint slavery was utterly and irretrievably bad, and to
bear testimony constant and consistent against it was part
of the high calling of the Christian.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Various Opinions.</p>


<p>Elias Hicks had very definite ideas on a great many
subjects. While in many respects he was in advance of his
time, at other points he was conservative. At any rate he
was not in unity with some of the prevalent social and
economic arrangements. On the question of property he
entertained some startling convictions. Just how much
public expression he gave to these views may not be positively
determined. That he believed that there were grave
spiritual dangers involved in getting and holding great
wealth, is abundantly attested in his public utterances, but
we must look to his private correspondence for some of his
advanced views on the property question.</p>

<p>In a letter addressed to "Dear Alsop," dated Jericho,
Fifth month 14, 1826, he deals quite definitely with the
matter of property. After claiming that the early Christians
wandered from the pure gospel of Jesus after they ceased
to rely on the inward teacher, he makes a declaration on the
subject as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But did we all as individuals take the spirit of truth,
or light within, as our only rule and guide in all things, we
should all then be willing, and thereby enabled, to do justly,
love mercy, and walk humbly with God. Then we should
hold all things in common, and call nothing our own, but
consider all our blessings as only lent to us, to be used and
distributed by us in such manner and way as his holy spirit,
or this inward teacher, may from time to time direct. Hence
we should be made all equal, accountable to none but God
alone, for the right use or the abuse of his blessings. Then
all mankind would be but one community, have but one
head, but one father, and the saying of Jesus would be veri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>fied.
We should no longer call any man master, for one
only has a right to be our Master, even God, and all mankind
become brethren. This is the kind of community that
I have been labouring for more than forty years to introduce
mankind into, that so we might all have but one head, and
one instructor and he (God) come to rule whose only right
it is, and which would always have been the case, had not
man rebelled against his maker, and disobeyed his salutary
instruction and commands."</p></blockquote>

<p>Touching the "cares and deceitfulness of riches," he
had much to say. He tells us that on a certain day he
attended the meeting of ministers and elders in Westbury,
and sat through it "under great depression and poverty of
spirit." There was evidently some confession and not a
little complaining, as there is now, regarding the possession
and exercise of spiritual gifts on the part of Friends. But
Elias affirmed that the "cloud" over the meeting was not
"in consequence of a deficiency of ministers, as it respects
their ministerial gifts, nor from a want of care in elders in
watching over them; but from a much more deep and melancholy
cause, viz.: the love and cares of this world and the
deceitfulness of riches; which, springing up and gaining the
ascendency in the mind, choke the good seed like the briars
and thorns, and render it fruitless; and produce such great
dearth and barrenness in our meetings."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Elias Hicks apparently believed that labor had in itself
a vital spiritual quality. In fact he held that the famous
injunction in Genesis "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou
eat bread" "was not a penalty, but it was a divine counsel&mdash;a
counsel of perfect wisdom and perfect love."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> It was his

labor, thus placing burdens on their fellows, which they

<p>Every exhortation touching labor he religiously followed
himself. He records that at the age of sixty he
labored hard in his harvest field, and remarks with evident
pride and satisfaction as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I found I could wield the scythe nearly as in the days
of my youth. It was a day of thankful and delightful contemplation.
My heart was filled with thankfulness and
gratitude to the blessed Author of my existence, in a consideration
of his providential care over me, in preserving me
in health, and in the possession of my bodily powers, the
exercise of which were still affording me both profit and
delight; and I was doubly thankful for the continued
exercise of my mental faculties, not only in instructing me
how to exert and rightly employ my bodily powers, in the
most useful and advantageous manner, but also in contemplating
the works of nature and Providence, in the
blessings and beauties of the field&mdash;a volume containing
more delightful and profitable <span class="correction" title="Originally: instructtion">instruction</span> than all the
volumes of mere learning and science in the world.</p>

<p>"What a vast portion of the joys and comforts of life
do the idle and slothful deprive themselves of, by running
into cities and towns, to avoid labouring in the field; not
considering that this is one of the principal sources that the
gracious Creator of the universe has appointed to his
creature, man, from whence he may derive great temporal
happiness and delight. It also opens the largest and best
field of exercise to the contemplative mind, by which it may
be prepared to meet, when this mortal puts on immortality,
those immortal joys that will ever be the lot of the faithful
and industrious."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It will probably be disputed in our time, that those
who labor and attempt to live in cities enjoy lives of greater
ease than those who till the soil.</p>

<p>While Elias recognized the obligation to labor, and
believed it was a blessed privilege, he had learned in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
school of experience that an over-worked body and an
over-worried mind tended to spiritual poverty. We quote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The rest of this week was spent in my ordinary
vocations. My farming business was very pressing, and it
being difficult to procure suitable assistance, my mind was
overburdened with care, which seldom fails of producing
leanness of spirit in a lesser or greater degree."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As offset to this we quote the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What a favor it is for such an active creature as man,
possessed of such powers of body and mind, always to have
some employment, and something for those powers to act
upon; for otherwise they would be useless and dormant,
and afford neither profit nor delight."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The building of railroads in this country had fairly begun
when Elias Hicks passed away in 1830. Projects had
been under way for some time, and certain Friends in Baltimore,
then the center of railroad activity, had become interested
in the enterprise. In a letter to Deborah and James
P. Stabler,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> written in New York, Sixth month 28, 1829,
Elias expresses himself quite freely regarding the matter.
He says: "It was a cause of sorrow rather than joy when
last in Baltimore to find my dear friend P. E. Thomas<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
fully engaged in that troublesome business of the railroad,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
as I consider his calling to be of a more noble and exalted
nature than to enlist in such low and groveling concerns.
For it is a great truth that no man can serve two masters,
for he will either love the one, and hate the other, or hold
to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and
mammon. The railroad in this case I consider mammon."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_73_73" id="Footnote_73_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> Deborah Stabler was the widow of Dr. William Stabler, the
latter being a brother of Edward Stabler, of Alexandria, the well-known
preacher, and close friend of Elias Hicks. Deborah was a recorded
minister. James P. was her son. He was chief engineer of
the Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad in its early construction, and
was the first general superintendent and chief engineer of the Baltimore
and Ohio, and built part of the line from Baltimore to Frederick.
He was the author of a small pamphlet entitled, "The Certain Evidences
of Practical Religion," published in 1884. He resided at Sandy Spring,
Md.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> Philip E. Thomas, for many years sat at the head of the Baltimore
meeting. He was the son of Evan Thomas, of Sandy Spring,
who was a recorded minister. Philip E. was an importing hardware
merchant, a most successful business man, and the first president of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. In the construction and operation
of that line of railroad, he was associated with the leading business
men of Baltimore. He was for many years an elder of Baltimore
meeting.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> The railroad thus referred to by Elias Hicks was undoubtedly
the section of the Baltimore and Ohio which ran from Baltimore to
Ellicott's Mills, a distance of 15 miles. It was begun in 1828, and opened
in Fifth month, 1830. Horses were at first used as motive power.
This was the first railroad built in the United States.</p></div>

<p>The following is an extract from the same letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It afforded me very pleasing sensations to be informed
of dear James' improvement in health, but it excited
some different feeling when informed that he had taken the
place of Assistant Superintendent of the railroad company,
a business I conceive that principally belongs to the men
of this world, but not to the children of light, whose kingdom
is not of this world; for when we consider that there
are thousands and tens of thousands who are voluntarily
enlisted in works that relate to the accommodation of flesh
and blood which can never inherit the kingdom of heaven."</p></blockquote>

<p>The objection to railroads is one of those unaccountable
but interesting contradictions which appear in the lives
of some progressive men. By a sort of irony of fate, Valentine
Hicks, the son-in-law of Elias, a few years after the
death of the latter, became very much interested in the
railroad business. The charter of the Long Island Railroad
Company was granted Fourth month 24, 1834. In this
document Valentine Hicks was named one of the commissioners
to secure the capital stock, and appoint the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
Board of Directors. While not the first president of that
company, he was elected president Sixth month 7, 1837,
and served in that capacity until Fifth month 21, 1838.</p>

<p>Elias Hicks at points anticipated the present theory of
suggestion touching bodily ailment, if he did not forestall
some of the ideas regarding mental healing, and Christian
Science. Writing to his son-in-law, Valentine Hicks, from
Easton, Pa., Eighth month 15, 1819, he thus expressed
himself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And indeed, in a strict sense, the mind or immortal
spirit of man cannot be affected with disease or sickness,
being endued with immortal powers; therefore all its
apparent weakness lies in mere imagination, giving the
mind a wrong bias and a wrong direction, but it loses more
of its real strength, as to acting and doing. For instance,
if at any time it admits those false surmises and imaginations,
and by them is led to believe that its outward tabernacle
is out of health and drawing towards a dissolution,
and not being ready and willing to part with it, although
little or nothing may be the disorder of the body, yet so
powerfully strong is the mind under the influence of these
wrong surmises that there seems at times to be no power
in heaven or earth sufficient to arrest its progress, or stop
its career, until it brings on actual disease, and death to
the body, which, however, had its beginning principally in
mere imagination and surmise. Hence we see the absolute
necessity of thinking less about our mere bodily health, and
much more about the mind, for if the mind is kept in a line
of right direction, as it is that in which all its right health
and strength consisteth, we need not fear any suffering to
the body. For, if while the mind is under right direction,
the body is permitted to fall under or into a state of affliction
or disease, and the mind is kept in a state of due
arrangement, it will prove a blessing and be sanctified to
us as such, and in which we shall learn by certain experience
that all things work together for good to those whose minds
are preserved under the regulating influence of the love of
God, which love casteth out all fear."</p></blockquote>

<p>Elias Hicks was a firm opponent of the public school
system, and especially the law which supported such schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
by general taxation. His views regarding this matter are
quite fully stated in a letter written Fifth month 24, 1820.
It was written to Sylvanus Smith, and answered certain inquiries
which had evidently been directed to Elias by this
Friend. His objection to public schools, however, was partly
based on what he considered moral and religious grounds.
He said he had refrained from sending his children to any
schools which were not under the immediate care of the
Society of Friends. Observation, he said, <span class="correction" title="Originally: lead">led</span> him to believe
that his "children would receive more harm than good
by attending schools taught by persons of no religious principles,
and among children whose parents were of different
sects, and many very loose and unconcerned and vulgar in
their lives and conduct." He also assumed that in the public
schools his children would be demoralized "by the vicious
conduct of many of the children, and sometimes even the
teachers, which would be very degrading to their morals,
and wounding to their tender minds." From his standpoint
Friends could not consistently "take any part in those district
schools, nor receive any part of the bounty given by
the legislature of the state for their use."</p>

<p>Touching the question of parental authority and individual
freedom, Elias Hicks also had opinions prejudicial
to the public schools. In the letter under review he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Believing the law that has established them to be
arbitrary and inconsistent with the liberty of conscience
guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, and
derogatory to right parental authority; as no doubt it is the
right and duty of every parent to bring up and educate his
children in that way he thinks is right, independent of the
control of any authority under heaven (so long as he keeps
them within the bounds of civil order). As the bringing
up and right education of our children is a religious duty,
and for which we are accountable to none but God only,
therefore for the magistrate to interfere therewith by
coercive means is an infringement upon the divine prerogative."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>The observance of Thanksgiving Day, outside of New
England, had not become a common thing in the time of
Elias Hicks. Evidently about 1825, the Governor of New
York issued a Thanksgiving Proclamation, which caused
Elias to write an article. It was addressed to <i>The Christian
Inquirer</i>,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and bore heavily against the whole thanksgiving
scheme, especially when supported by the civil government.
In his opinion wherever the magistrate recommended an observance
of Thanksgiving Day, he was simply playing into
the hands of the ecclesiastical power. We quote:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_76_76" id="Footnote_76_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> The <i>Christian Inquirer</i> was a weekly newspaper in New York,
started in 1824. It was of pronounced liberal tendencies. A good deal
of its space was devoted to Friends, especially during the "separation"
period.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"Therefore the Governor's recommendation carries the
same coercion and force in it, to every citizen, as the recommendation
of the Episcopal Bishop would to the members
of his own church. In this view we have the reason
why the clergymen in our state call upon the civil magistrate
to recommend one of their superstitious ceremonies.
It is in order to coerce the citizens at large to a compliance
with their dogmas, and little by little inure them to the
yoke of ecclesiastical domination. I therefore conceive
there is scarcely a subject that comes under our notice that
lies more justly open to rebuke and ridicule than the
thanksgiving days and fast days that are observed in our
country, for there is nothing to be found in the writings of
the New Testament to warrant such formality and superstition,
and I fully believe in the way they are conducted
they are altogether an abomination in the sight of the
Lord, and tend more abundantly to bring a curse upon our
nation than a blessing, as they too often end with many
in festivity and drunkenness."</p></blockquote>

<p>In closing his communication Elias says that in issuing
his proclamation the Governor was simply "doing a piece
of drudgery" for the clergy. The following, being the last
paragraph in the communication referred to, sounds very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
much like the statements put forward by the extreme
secularists in our own time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And has he not by recommending a religious act
united the civil and ecclesiastical authorities, and broken
the line of partition between them, so wisely established
by our enlightened Constitution, which in the most positive
terms forbids any alliance between church and state, and
is the only barrier for the support of our liberty and independence.
For if that is broken down all is lost, and we
become the vassals of priestcraft, and designing men, who
are reaching after power by every subtle contrivance to
domineer over the consciences of their fellow citizens."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not at all surprising that Elias Hicks was opposed
to Free Masonry. On this subject he expressed himself
vigorously. This opposition was based upon the secret character
of the oath, and especially a solemn promise not to
divulge the "secrets of Masonry, before he knows what the
secrets are."</p>

<p>The anti-masonic movement, being the outcome of the
mysterious disappearance of William Morgan from Batavia,
New York, was at its height during the last years of Elias
Hicks. It was claimed that Morgan was probably murdered
because of a book published by him in 1826, exposing the
secrets of Masonry. Some of the rumors connected with
this disappearance account for statements made by Elias
Hicks in his criticism of the organization.</p>

<p>Touching the matter of exclusiveness on the part of
Friends, Elias Hicks was a conservative of the conservatives.
To keep aloof from things not connected with the
Society he considered a virtue in itself. In referring to a
meeting he attended in Goshen, Pa., he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Had to caution Friends against mixing with the people
in their human policies, and outward forms of government;
showing that, in all ages, those who were called to be the
Lord's people had been ruined, or suffered great loss, by
such associations; and manifesting clearly by Scripture tes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>timony,
and other records, that our strength and preservation
consisted in standing alone, and not to be counted
among the people or nations, who were setting up party, and
partial interest, one against another, which is the ground of
war and bloodshed. These are actuated by the spirit of
pride and wrath, which is always opposed to the true Christian
spirit, which breathes 'peace on earth, and good will to
all men.' Those, therefore, who are in the true Christian
spirit cannot use any coercive force or compulsion by any
means whatever; not being overcome with evil, but overcoming
evil with good."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a name="Footnote_77_77" id="Footnote_77_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> Journal, p. 76-77.</p></div>

<p>In the article in which he condemned Masonry, Elias
Hicks spoke vigorously in criticism of the camp meetings
held by some of the churches. He called them "night
revels," and considered them "a very great nuisance to civil
society." He thought they were promoters of "licentiousness,
immorality and drunkenness," and were more or less
reproachful to the Christian name, "giving much occasion
for infidels to scoff."</p>

<p>While at Elizabeth, in New Jersey, Elias wrote a letter<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
to a young man named Samuel Cox. It seems that this
person contemplated studying for the ministry; that his
grandmother was a Friend, and Elias labored with the
grandson on her account. He said that "human study or
human science" could not qualify a minister. In fact to
suppose such a thing was to cast "the greatest possible indignity
on the Divine Being, and on the gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ." Of course it was asserted that ministry came
only by the power of the Spirit, and much Scripture was
quoted to prove it. There is little in the writings of Elias
Hicks to show that he considered that equipping the natural
powers was helpful in making the spiritual inspiration

<p>It is evident, however, that Elias was not indifferent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span>
to his own intellectual equipment. He was fond of quoting
from books the things which fortified his own position.
The following shows how he stored his mind with facts,
from which he drew certain conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Indisposition of body prevented my attending meeting.
I therefore spent the day quietly at home, and in
reading a portion of Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History of
the Fifth Century, and which is indeed enough to astonish
any sensible, considerate man, to think how the professors
of that day could be hardy enough to call themselves Christians,
while using every artifice that their human wisdom
could invent to raise themselves to power and opulence, and
endeavoring to crush down their opposers by almost every
cruelty that power, envy and malice could inflict, to the
entire scandal of the Christian name; and changing the pure,
meek, merciful and undefiled religion of Jesus into an impure,
unmerciful, cruel, bloody and persecuting religion.
For each of those varied sects of professed Christians, in
their turn, as they got the power of the civil magistrate on
their side, would endeavor, by the sword, and severe edicts,
followed by banishment, to reduce and destroy all those who
dissented from them, although their opinions were not a
whit more friendly to real, genuine Christianity than the
tenets of their opposers; for all were, in great measure, if
not entirely, adulterated and apostatized from the true spirit
of Christianity, which breathes peace on earth, and good
will to men."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Elias Hicks believed that there was a sure way of
determining conduct, whether it was from "one's own will,"
or whether it proceeded from the divine leading. In regard
to this matter, he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But the great error of the generality of professed
Christians lies in not making a right distinction between the
works that men do in their own will, and by the leadings
of their own carnal wisdom, and those works that the true
believer does, in the will and wisdom of God. For although
the former, let them consist in what they will, whether in
prayers, or preaching, or any other devotional exercises,
are altogether evil; so on the contrary those of the latter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
let them consist in what they may, whether in ploughing,
in reaping, or in any handicraft labor, or in any other
service, temporal or spiritual, as they will in all be accompanied
with the peace and presence of their heavenly Father,
so all they do will be righteous, and will be imputed to them
as such."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>His contention regarding this matter is possibly more
clearly stated in the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The meeting was large, wherein I had to expose the
danger of self-righteousness, or a trust in natural religion,
or mere morality; showing that it was no more than the
religion of Atheists, and was generally the product of pride
and self-will; and, however good it may appear to the
natural unregenerate man, is as offensive in the divine
sight as those more open evils which appear so very reproachful
to the eyes of men. I was favored by the spirit
of truth, in a large, searching testimony, to the convicting
and humbling many hearts, and comfort of the faithful."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This is not unlike statements often made in modern
revivals, touching the absolute uselessness of good works,
without the operation of divine grace, in bringing salvation.</p>

<p>A broader view of goodness and its sources seems to
have been taken by Clement, of Alexandria<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> who said: "For
God is the cause of all good things; but of some primarily,

<p class="subtitle">Some Points of Doctrine.</p>


<p>Elias Hicks had ideas of the future life, salvation, rewards
and punishments, sometimes original, and in some
respects borrowed or adapted from prevalent opinions. But
in all conclusions reached he seems to have thought his own
way out, and was probably unconscious of having been a
borrower at all. He believed unfalteringly in the immortality
of the soul, and held that the soul of man is immortal,
because it had its origin in an immortal God. Every sin
committed "is a transgression against his immutable and unchangeable
law, and is an immortal sin, as it pollutes and
brings death on the immortal soul of man, which nothing
in heaven nor in the earth but God alone can extinguish
or forgive, and this he will never do, but upon his own
righteous and merciful conditions, which consist in nothing
more nor less than sincere repentance and amendment of
life."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

at Jericho, Second month 22, 1828.</p></div>

<p>It will be noted that this statement was made near the
close of his career, and has been purposely selected because
it undoubtedly expressed his final judgment in the matter.
In all probability the words used were not meant to be
taken literally, such for instance as those referring to the
"death" of the soul. There is little, if any reason to think
that Elias Hicks believed in the annihilation of the sinner.</p>

<p>Touching sin he further explained his position. Whatever
God creates is "immutably good." "Therefore if there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
is any such thing as sin and iniquity in the world, then God
has neither willed it nor ordained it."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> His position regarding
this point caused him to antagonize and repudiate the
doctrine of foreordination. From his standpoint this involved
the creation of evil by the Almighty, a thoroughly
preposterous supposition. Again, he held that if God had,
"previous to man's creation, willed and determined all of
his actions, then certainly every man stands in the same state
of acceptance with him, and a universal salvation must take
place: which I conceive the favorers of foreordination would
be as unwilling as myself to believe."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Three years after the declaration quoted above, Elias
Hicks wrote a letter<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> to a person known as "J. N.," who
was a believer in universal salvation. In this letter he revives
his idea that foreordination and universal salvation
are twin heresies, both equally mischievous. This letter
is very long, containing nearly 4,000 words. The bulk of it
deals with the theory of predestination, while some of it
relates to the matter of sin and penalty. At one point the
letter is censorious, nearly borders on the dogmatic, and is
scarcely kind. We quote:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_87_87" id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> Letter dated Baltimore, Tenth month, 1817.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"Hadst thou, in thy researches after knowledge, been
concerned to know the first step of wisdom&mdash;the right
knowledge of thyself&mdash;such an humbling view of thy own
insufficiency and entire ignorance of the Divine Being, and
all his glorious attributes, would, I trust, have preserved
thee from falling into thy present errors. Errors great
indeed, and fatal in their consequences; for if men were
capable of believing with confidence thy opinions, either as
regards the doctrine of unconditional predestination and
election, or the doctrine of universal salvation, both of
which certainly and necessarily resolve in one, who could
any longer call any thing he has his own? for all would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span>
fall a prey to the villains and sturdy rogues of this belief.
And, indeed, a belief of these opinions would most assuredly
make thousands more of that description than there already
are; as every temptation to evil, to gratify the carnal desires,
would be yielded to, as that which was ordained
to be; and of course would be considered as something
agreeable to God's good pleasure; and therefore not only
our goods and chattels would become a prey to every
ruffian of this belief, but even our wives and daughters
would fall victims to the superior force of the abandoned
and profligate, as believing they could do nothing but what
God had ordained to be. But we are thankful in the sentiment
that no rational, intelligent being can possibly embrace,
in full faith, these inconsistent doctrines; as they
are founded on nothing but supposition; and supposition
can never produce real belief, or a faith that any rational
creature can rely upon."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We make no attempt to clear up the logical connection
between the doctrine of foreordination and the theory of
universal salvation, for it is by no means clear that the two
necessarily belong together. From the reasoning of Elias
Hicks it would seem that he considered salvation a transaction
which made a fixed and final condition for the soul
at death, whereas the Universalist theory simply provides
for a future turning of all souls toward God. Surely the
supposition that the holding of the views of "J. N." would
bring the moral disorder and disaster outlined by his critic
had not then been borne out by the facts, and has not since.
Neither the believers in foreordination or universal salvation
have been shown worse than other men, or more socially
dangerous.</p>

<p>"Sin," he says, "arises entirely out of the corrupt independent
will of man; and which will is not of God's creating,
but springs up and has its origin in man's disobedience
and transgression, by making a wrong use of his liberty."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span><a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
As the sin is of man's voluntary commission, the penalty is
also to be charged to the sinner, and not to God. On this
point Elias Hicks was clear in his reasoning and in his conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Hence those who make their election to good, and
choose to follow the teachings of the inward law of the
spirit of God, are of course leavened into the true nature
of God, and consequently into the happiness of God. For
nothing but that which is of the nature of God can enjoy the
happiness of God. But he who makes his election, or
choice, to turn away from God's law and spirit, and govern
himself or is governed by his own will and spirit, becomes
a corrupt tree and although the same justice, wisdom,
power, mercy and love are dispensed to this man as to the
other, yet by his contrary nature, which has become fleshly,
by following his fleshly inclinations, he brings forth corrupt
fruit."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Manifestly the idea that the Almighty punishes men
for his own glory had no place in the thinking of the Jericho
preacher.</p>

<p>The theory of sin and penalty held by Elias Hicks
necessarily led him to hold opinions regarding rewards and
punishments, and the place and manner of their application,
at variance with commonly accepted notions. In fact, the
apparent irregularity of his thinking in this particular was
one of the causes of concern on his behalf on the part of
his captious critics and some of his friends. One of the
latter had evidently written him regarding this matter, and
his reply is before us.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> From it we quote:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_91_91" id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> Letter dated Jericho, Third month 14, 1808.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"As to the subject relative to heaven and hell, I suppose
what gave rise to that part of my communication
(although I have now forgotten the particulars) was a
concern that at that time as well as many other times has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>
sorrowfully impressed my mind, in observing the great
ignorance and carnality that was not only prevailing among
mankind at large, but more especially in finding it to be
the case with many professing with us in relation to those
things. An ignorance and carnality that, in my opinion,
has been one great cause of the prevailing Atheism and
Deism that now abounds among the children of men. For
what reason or argument could a professed Christian bring
forward to convince an Atheist or Deist that there is such
a place as heaven as described and circumscribed in some
certain limits and place in some distant and unknown
region as is the carnal idea of too many professing Christianity,
and even of many, I fear, of us? Or such a place
as hell, or a gulf located in some interior part of this little
terraqueous globe? But when the Christian brings forward
to the Atheist or Deist reasons and arguments founded on
indubitable certainty, things that he knows in his own experience
every day through the powerful evidence of the
divine law-giver in his own heart, he cannot fail of yielding
his assent, for he feels as he goes on in unbelief and
hardness of heart he is plunging himself every day deeper
and deeper into that place of torment, and let him go
whithersoever he will, his hell goes with him. He can no
more be rid of it than he can be rid of himself. And
although he flies to the rocks and mountains to fall on him,
to deliver him from his tremendous condition, yet he finds
all is in vain, for where God is, there hell is always to the
sinner; according to that true saying of our dear Lord, 'this
is the condemnation of the world that light is come into the
world, but men love darkness rather than the light, because
their deeds are evil.' Now God, or Christ (who are one in
a spiritual sense), is this light that continually condemns
the transgressor. Therefore, where God or Christ is, there
is hell always to the sinner, and God, according to Scripture
and the everyday experience of every rational creature, is
everywhere present, for he fills all things, and by him all
things consist. And as the sinner finds in himself and
knows in his own experience that there is a hell, and one
that he cannot possibly escape while he remains a sinner,
so likewise the righteous know, and that by experience,
that there is a heaven, but they know of none above the
outward clouds and outward atmosphere. They have no
experience of any such, but they know a heaven where
God dwells, and know a sitting with him at seasons in
heavenly places in Christ Jesus."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>It will be remembered that Elias based salvation on
repentance and amendment of life, but the bulk of his expression
would seem to indicate that he held to the idea that
repentance must come during this life. In fact, an early
remark of his gives clear warrant for this conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> He
does not seem to have ever adopted the theory that continuity
of life carried with it continuation of opportunity touching
repentance and restoration of the soul.</p>

<p>From the twentieth century standpoint views like the
foregoing would scarcely cause a ripple of protest in any
well-informed religious circles. But eighty years ago the
case was different. A material place for excessively material
punishment of the soul, on account of moral sin and
spiritual turpitude, was essential to orthodox standing in
practically every branch of the Christian church, with possibly
two or three exceptions. Elias Hicks practically
admits that in the Society of Friends not a few persons
held to the gross and materialistic conceptions which he
criticised and repudiated.</p>

<p>The question of personal immortality was more than
once submitted to him for consideration. After certain
Friends began to pick flaws with his ideas and theories, he
was charged with being a doubter regarding nearly all the
common Christian affirmations, immortality included.
There was little reason for misunderstanding or misrepresenting
him in this particular, for, however he failed to
make himself understood touching other points of doctrine,
he was perfectly clear on this point. In a letter to Charles
Stokes, of Rancocas, N. J., written Fourth month 3, 1829,
he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Can it be possibly necessary for me to add anything
further, to manifest my full and entire belief of the immortality
of the soul of man? Surely, what an ignorant creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span>
must that man be that hath not come to the clear and
full knowledge of that in himself. Does not every man feel
a desire fixed in his very nature after happiness, that urges
him on in a steady pursuit after something to satisfy this
desire, and does he not find that all the riches and honor
and glory of this world, together with every thing that is
mortal, falls infinitely short of satisfying this desire? which
proves it to be immortal; and can any thing, or being, that
is not immortal in itself, receive the impress of an immortal
desire upon it? Surely not. Therefore, this immortal desire
of the soul of man never can be fully satisfied until
it comes to be established in a state of immortality and
eternal life, beyond the grave."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There are not many direct references to immortality
in the published sermons, although inferences in that direction
are numerous. In a sermon at Darby, Pa., Twelfth
month 7, 1826, he declared: "We see then that the great
business of our lives is 'to lay up treasure in heaven.'"<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In
this case and others like it he evidently means treasure in
the spiritual world. In his discourses he frequently referred
to "our immortal souls" in a way to leave no doubt
as to his belief in a continuity of life. His reference to the
death of his young sons leave no room for doubt in the
matter.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>In speaking of the death of his wife, both in his Journal
and in his private correspondence, his references all point
to the future life. "Her precious spirit," he said, "I trust
and believe has landed safely on the angelic shore." Again,
"being preserved together fifty-eight years in one unbroken
bond of endeared affection, which seemed if possible to
increase with time to the last moment of her life; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>

<p>During the last ten years of the life of Elias Hicks he
was simply overburdened answering questions and explaining
his position touching a multitude of views charged
against him by his critics and defamers. Among the matters
thus brought to his attention was the miraculous conception
of Jesus, and the various beliefs growing out of that doctrine.
In an undated manuscript found among his papers
and letters, and manifestly not belonging to a date earlier
than 1826 or 1827, he pretty clearly states his theory touching
this delicate subject. In this document he is more
definite than he is in some of his published statements
relating to the same matter. He asserts that there is a
difference between "begetting and creating." He scouts
as revolting the conception that the Almighty begat Jesus,
as is the case in the animal function of procreation. On
the other hand, he said: "But, as in the beginning of creation,
he spake the word and it was done, so by his almighty
power he spake the word and by it created the seed of man
in the fleshly womb of Mary." In other words, the miraculous
conception was a creation and not the act of begetting.</p>

<p>In his correspondence he repeatedly asserted that he
had believed in the miraculous conception from his youth
up. To Thomas Willis, who was one of his earliest accusers,
he said that "although there appeared to me as

Evangelists against as for the support of that miracle, yet
it had not altered my belief therein."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> It has to be admitted
that the miraculous conception held by Elias Hicks

evangelical Christians in the early part of the nineteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>
century. His theory may be more rational than the popular
conception and may be equally miraculous, but it was not
the same proposition.</p>

<p>Whether Elias considered this a distinction without a
difference we know not, but it is very certain that he did not
consider the miracle or the dogma growing out of it a vital
matter. He declared that a "belief therein was not an
essential to salvation."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> His reason for this opinion was
that "whatever is essential to the salvation of the souls of
men is dispensed by a common creator to every rational
creature under heaven."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> No hint of a miraculous conception,
he held, had been revealed to the souls of men.</p>

<p>It is possible that in the minds of the ultra Orthodox,
to deny the saving value of a belief in the miraculous conception,
although admitting it as a fact, or recasting it as a
theory, was a more reprehensible act of heresy than denying
the dogma entirely. Manifestly Elias Hicks was altogether
too original in his thinking to secure his own peace
and comfort in the world of nineteenth-century theology.</p>

<p>When we consider the theory of the divinity of Christ,
and the theory of the incarnation, we find Elias Hicks
taking the affirmative side, but even here it is questionable
if he was affirming the popular conception. Touching these
matters he put himself definitely on record in 1827 in a
letter written to an unnamed Friend. In this letter he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As to the divinity of Christ, the son of the virgin&mdash;when
he had arrived to a full state of sonship in the spiritual
generation, he was wholly swallowed up into the divinity
of his heavenly Father, and was one with his Father, with
only this difference: his Father's divinity was underived,
being self-existent, but the son's divinity was altogether
derived from the Father; for otherwise he could not be the
son of God, as in the moral relation, to be a son of man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>
the son must be begotten by one father, and he must be in
the same nature, spirit and likeness of his father, so as to
say, I and my father are one in all those respects. But this
was not the case with Jesus in the spiritual relation, until
he had gone through the last institute of the law dispensation,
viz., John's watery baptism, and had received additional
power from on high, by the descending of the holy
ghost upon him, as he came up out of the water. He then
witnessed the fulness of the second birth, being now born
into the nature, spirit and likeness of the heavenly Father,
and God gave witness of it to John, saying, 'This is my
beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.' And this agrees
with Paul's testimony, where he assures us that as many
as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of
God."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Just as he repudiated material localized places of reward
and punishment, Elias Hicks disputed the presence in
the world of a personal evil spirit, roaming around seeking
whom he might ensnare and devour. In fact, in his theology
there was no tinge of the Persian dualism. Satan,
from his standpoint, had no existence outside man. He
was simply a figure to illustrate the evil propensity in men.
In the estimation of the ultra Orthodox to claim that there
was no personal devil, who tempted our first parents in
Eden, was second only in point of heresy to denying the
existence of God himself&mdash;the two persons both being essential
parts in the theological system to which they tenaciously
held.</p>

<p>Touching this matter he thus expressed himself:
"And as to what is called a devil or satan, it is something
within us, that tempts us to go counter to the commands of
God, and our duty to him and our fellow creatures; and the
Scriptures tell us there are many of them, and that Jesus
cast seven out of one woman."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>He was charged with being a Deist, and an infidel of
the Thomas Paine stripe, yet from his own standpoint
there was no shadow of truth in any of these charges. His
references to Atheism and Deism already cited in these pages
afford evidence on this point. In 1798 he was at Gap in
Pennsylvania, and in referring to his experience there he
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whilst in this neighborhood my mind was brought
into a state of deep exercise and travail, from a sense of the
great turning away of many of us, from the law and the
testimony, and the prevailing of a spirit of great infidelity
and deism among the people, and darkness spreading over
the minds of many as a thick veil. It was a time in which
Thomas Paine's Age of Reason (falsely so called) was much
attended to in those parts; and some, who were members
in our Society, as I was informed, were captivated by his
dark insinuating address, and were ready almost to make
shipwreck of faith and a good conscience. Under a sense
thereof my spirit was deeply humbled before the majesty
of heaven, and in the anguish of my soul I said, 'spare thy
people, O Lord, and give not thy heritage to reproach,' and
suffer not thy truth to fall in the streets."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Touching his supposed Unitarianism, there are no direct
references to that theory in his published works. A
letter written by Elias Hicks to William B. Irish,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Second
month 11, 1821, is about the only reference to the matter.
In this letter he says:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_103_103" id="Footnote_103_103"></a><a href="#FNanchor_103_103"><span class="label">[103]</span></a> William B. Irish lived in Pittsburg, and was a disciple of Elias
Hicks, as he confessed to his spiritual profit. In a letter written to
Elias from Philadelphia, Eleventh month 21, 1823, he said: "I tell
you, you are the first man that ever put my mind in search of heavenly
food." Whether he ever united with the Society we are not informed,
although Elias expressed the hope that he might see his way clear to
do so.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"In regard to the Unitarian doctrine, I am too much a
stranger to their general tenets to give a decided sentiment,
but according to the definition given of them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span>
Dyche in his dictionary, I think it is more consistent and
rational than the doctrine of the trinity, which I think fairly
makes out three Gods. But as I have lately spent some time
in perusing the ancient history of the church, in which I
find that Trinitarians, Unitarians, Arians, Nestorians and a
number of other sects that sprung up in the night of apostacy,
as each got into power they cruelly persecuted each
other, by which they evidenced that they had all apostatized
from the primitive faith and practice, and the genuine spirit
of Christianity, hence I conceive there is no safety in joining
with any of those sects, as their leaders I believe are generally
each looking to their own quarter for gain. Therefore
our safety consists in standing alone (waiting at
Jerusalem) that is in a quiet retired state, similar to the
disciples formerly, until we receive power from on high, or
until by the opening of that divine spirit (or comforter, a
manifestation of which is given to every man and woman
to profit withal) we are led into the knowledge of the
truth agreeably to the doctrine of Jesus to his disciples."</p></blockquote>

<p>In regard to the death and resurrection of Jesus, Elias
Hicks considered himself logically and scripturally sound,
although his ideas may not have squared with any prevalent
theological doctrines. In reply to the query, "By what
means did Jesus suffer?" he answered unhesitatingly, "By
the hands of wicked men." A second query was to the
effect, "Did God send him into the world purposely to suffer
death?" Here is the answer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"By no means: but to live a righteous and godly life
(which was the design and end of God's creating man in
the beginning), and thereby be a perfect example to such
of mankind as should come to the knowledge of him and of
his perfect life. For if it was the purpose and will of God
that he should die by the hands of wicked men, then the
Jews, by crucifying him, would have done God's will, and
of course would all have stood justified in his sight, which
could not be." ... "But the shedding of his
blood by the wicked scribes and Pharisees, and people of
Israel, had a particular effect on the Jewish nation, as by
this the topstone and worst of all their crimes, was filled up
the measure of their iniquities, and which put an end to that
dispensation, together with its law and covenant. That as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
John's baptism summed up in one, all the previous water
baptisms of that dispensation, and put an end to them,
which he sealed with his blood, so this sacrifice of the body
of Jesus Christ, summed up in one all the outward atoning
sacrifices of the shadowy dispensation and put an end to
them all, thereby abolishing the law having previously fulfilled
all its righteousness, and, as saith the apostle, 'He
blotted out the handwriting of ordinances, nailing them to
his cross;' having put an end to the law that commanded
them, with all its legal sins, and abolished all its legal penalties,
so that all the Israelites that believed on him after
he exclaimed on the cross 'It is finished,' might abstain
from all the rituals of their law, such as circumcision, water
baptisms, outward sacrifices, Seventh-day Sabbaths, and all
their other holy days, etc."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_104_104" id="Footnote_104_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_104_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> All of the extracts above are from a letter to Dr. Nathan Shoemaker,
of Philadelphia, written Third month 31, 1823. See "Foster's
Report," pp. 422-23.</p></div>

<p>Continuing, he says: "Now all this life, power and will
of man, must be slain and die on the cross spiritually, as
Jesus died on the cross outwardly, and this is the true atonement,
of which that outward atonement was a clear and
full type." For the scriptural proof of his contention he
quotes Romans VI, 3:4. He claimed that the baptism referred
to by Paul was spiritual, and the newness of life to
follow must also be spiritual.</p>

<p>The resurrection was also spiritualized, and given an
internal, rather than an external, significance. Its intent
was to awaken in "the believer a belief in the sufficiency of
an invisible power, that was able to do any thing and every
thing that is consistent with justice, mercy and truth, and
that would conduce to the exaltation and good of his creature
man."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Therefore the resurrection of the dead body of Jesus
that could not possibly of itself create in itself a power to
loose the bonds of death, and which must consequently
have been the work of an invisible power, points to and is
a shadow of the resurrection of the soul that is dead in tres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>passes
and sins, and that hath no capacity to quicken itself,
but depends wholly on the renewed influence and quickening
power of the spirit of God. For a soul dead in trespasses
and sins can no more raise a desire of itself for a
renewed quickening of the divine life in itself than a dead
body can raise a desire of itself for a renewal of natural
life; but both equally depend on the omnipotent presiding
power of the spirit of God, as is clearly set forth by the
prophet under the similitude of the resurrection of dry
bones." Ezekiel, 37:1.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>"Hence the resurrection of the outward fleshly body of
Jesus and some few others under the law dispensation, as
manifested to the external senses of man, gives full evidence
as a shadow, pointing to the sufficiency of the divine
invisible power of God to raise the soul from a state of
spiritual death into newness of life and into the enjoyment
of the spiritual substance of all the previous shadows of
the law state. And by the arising of this Sun of Righteousness
in the soul all shadows flee away and come to an end,
and the soul presses forward, under its divine influence,
into that that is within the veil, where our forerunner, even
Jesus, has entered for us, showing us the way into the
holiest of holies."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We have endeavored to give such a view of the doctrinal
points covered as will give a fair idea of what Elias
Hicks believed. Whether they were unsound opinions, such
as should have disrupted the Society of Friends, and nearly
shipwreck it on a sea of bitterness, we leave for the reader
to decide. It should be stated, however, that the opinions
herein set forth did not, by any means, constitute the subject
matter of all, or possibly a considerable portion of the
sermons he preached. There is room for the inquiry in our
time whether a large amount of doctrinal opinion presented
in our meetings for worship, even though it be of the kind
in which the majority apparently believe, would not have a
dividing and scattering effect.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Before the Division.</p>


<p>No biography of Elias Hicks could be even approximately
adequate which ignored the division in the Society
of Friends in 1827-1828, commonly, but erroneously, called
"the separation." While his part in the trouble has been
greatly exaggerated, inasmuch as he was made the storm-center
of the controversy by his opponents, to consider the
causes and influences which led to the difficulty, especially
as they were either rightly or wrongly made to apply to
Elias Hicks, is vital to a study of his life, and an appreciation
of his labors.</p>

<p>We shall not be able to understand the matter at all,
unless we can in a measure take ourselves back to the first
quarter of the nineteenth century, and as far as possible
appreciate the thought and life of that time. We must remember
that a system of dogmatic theology, unqualified
and untempered by any of the findings of modern scholarship,
was the central and dominating influence in the religious
world. Authority of some sort was the source of
religious belief, and uniformity of doctrine the basis of
religious fellowship.</p>

<p>The aftermath of the French Revolution appeared in
a period of religious negation. Destructive, rather than
constructive criticism was the ruling passion of the unchurched
world. The conservative mind was burdened with
apprehension, and the fear of a chaos of faith possessed the
minds of the preachers, the theologians and the communicants
of the so-called Orthodox Christian churches. The
Unitarian uprising in New England had hopelessly divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
the historic church of the Puritans, and the conservative
Friends saw in every advance in thought the breaking up
of what they considered the foundations of religion, and
fear possessed them accordingly.</p>

<p>But more important than this is the fact that Friends
had largely lost the historic perspective, touching their own
origin. They had forgotten that their foundations were
laid in a revolt against a prevalent theology, and the evil of
external authority in religion. From being persecuted they
had grown popular and prosperous. They therefore shrank
from change in <span class="correction" title="Originally: zion">Zion</span>, and from the opposition and ostracism
which always had been the fate of those who broke with
approved and established religious standards. Without
doubt they honored the heroism and respected the sacrifices
of the fathers as the "first spreaders of truth." But they
had neither the temper nor the taste to be alike heroic, in
making Quakerism a progressive spirit, rather than a final
refuge of a traditional religion.</p>

<p>An effort was made by the opponents of Elias Hicks
to make it appear that what they were pleased to call his
"unsoundness in doctrine," came late in life, and somewhat
suddenly. But for this claim there is little if any valid evidence.
His preaching probably underwent little vital change
throughout his entire ministry. Turner, the English historian,
says: "But the facts remain that until near the close
of his long life Hicks was in general esteem, that there is
no sign anywhere in his writings of a change of opinions,
or new departure in his teaching."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>There is unpublished correspondence which confirms
the opinion of Turner. This is true touching what might
be called his theological as well as his sociological notions.</p>

<p>In a letter written to Elias Hicks in 1805, by James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>
Mott, Sr.,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> reference is made to Elias having denied the
absolutely saving character of the Scriptures. In this connection
the letter remarks: "I conceive it is no matter how
highly people value the Scriptures, provided they can only
be convinced that the spirit that gave them forth is superior
to them, and to be their rule and guide instead of them."</p>

the father of James, the husband of Lucretia. James Mott, Sr. died
in 1823.</p></div>

<p>In 1806, in a sermon at Nine Partners, in Dutchess
County, New York, as reported by himself, he declared that
men can only by "faithful attention and adherence to the
aforesaid divine principle, the light within, come to know
and believe the certainty of those excellent Scripture doctrines,
of the coming, life, righteous works, sufferings,
death and resurrection of Jesus Christ our blessed pattern;
and that <i>it is by obedience to this inward light only</i> that
we are prepared for admittance into the heavenly kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>It seems, however, that Stephen Grellet,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> if we may
take the authority of his biographers, Hodgson<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and
Guest,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> as early as 1808, was fearful of the orthodoxy of
Elias Hicks, and probably based his fear on extracts like
the passage cited above. Whatever may be imagined to
the contrary, it is pretty certain that at no time for forty
years before his death did Elias Hicks preach doctrine that
would have been satisfactory to the orthodox theologians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
of his time, although he did not always antagonize the
dogmas of the churches.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_110_110" id="Footnote_110_110"></a><a href="#FNanchor_110_110"><span class="label">[110]</span></a> Stephen Grellet, born in Limoges, France, Eleventh month 2,
1773. A scion of the French nobility. Became interested in the Society
of Friends when about twenty years of age. Came to America in
1795, and was recorded a minister in Philadelphia, in 1798. Became
a New York business man in 1799. Made extensive religious visits in
various countries in Europe, and in many American states. Was also
active in philanthropic work. He died at Burlington, N. J., in 1855.
In his theology he was entirely evangelical.</p></div>

<p>If Stephen Grellet ever had any personal interview
with Elias Hicks regarding his "unsoundness," the matter
was ignored by the latter. In Eighth month, 1808, some
months after it is claimed the discovery was made by
Grellet, the two men, with other Friends, were on a religious
visit in parts of New England. In a letter to his wife,
dated Danby, Vt., Eighth month 26, 1808, Elias says:
"Stephen Grellet, Gideon Seaman, Esther Griffin and Ann
Mott we left yesterday morning at a town called Middlebury,
about eighteen miles short of this place, Stephen feeling
a concern to appoint a meeting among the town's people
of that place." Evidently no very great barrier existed
between the two men at that time.</p>

<p>In any event no disposition seemed to exist to inaugurate
a theological controversy in the Society of Friends, or
to erect a standard of fellowship other than spiritual unity,
until a decade after the claimed concern of Stephen Grellet.
It appears that in 1818, Phebe Willis, wife of Thomas
Willis, a recorded minister of Jericho Monthly Meeting,
had a written communication with Elias, touching his doctrinal
"soundness," Phebe being an elder. That the opposition
began in Jericho, and that it was confined to the
Willis family and one other in that meeting, seems to be a
fairly well attested fact. In 1829, after the division in the
Society had been accomplished, Elias Hicks wrote a letter
to a friend giving a short history of the beginning of the
trouble in Jericho, from which we make the following
extract:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The beginning of the rupture in our yearly meeting
had its rise in our particular monthly meeting, and I have
full evidence before me of both its rise and progress. The
first shadow of complaint against me as to my doctrines
was made by Thomas Willis, a member and minister of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span>
own preparative meeting. He manifested his first uneasiness
at the close of one of our own meetings nearly in these
words, between him and myself alone. 'That he apprehended
that I, in my public communication, lowered down
the character of Jesus and the Scriptures of truth.' My
reply to him was that I had placed them both upon the
very foundation they each had placed themselves, and that
I dare not place them any higher or lower. At the same
time the whole monthly meeting, except he and his wife,
as far as I knew, were in full unity with me, both as to
my ministry and otherwise, but as they were both members
of the meeting of ministers and elders they made the first
public disclosure of their uneasiness. Thomas had an
ancient mother, likewise a minister, that lived in the house
with them; they so far overcame her better judgment as to
induce her to take a part with them, although she was a
very amiable and useful member, and one that I had always
a great esteem for, and we had been nearly united together
in gospel fellowship, both in public meetings and those for
discipline, for forty years and upward."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The meeting, through a judicious committee, tried to
quiet the fears of Thomas Willis and wife, and bring them
in unity with the vastly major portion of the meeting, but
without success. These Friends being persistent in their
opposition, they were suspended from the meeting of ministers
and elders, but were permitted to retain their membership
in the Society.</p>

<p class="subtitle">First Trouble in Philadelphia.</p>


<p>Transferring the story of the opposition to the ministry
of Elias Hicks to Philadelphia, it would appear that
its first public manifestation occurred in 1819. During this
year he made his fifth somewhat extended religious visit
to the meetings within the bounds of Philadelphia Yearly
Meeting. Elias was attending the monthly meeting then
held in the Pine Street meeting-house, and obtained liberty
to visit the women's meeting. While absent on this concern,
the men's meeting did the unprecedented thing of adjourning,
the breaking up of the meeting being accomplished by
a few influential members. For a co-ordinate branch of a
meeting for discipline to close while service was being performed
in the allied branch in accord with regular procedure
was considered irregular, if not unwarranted. The real
inspiring cause for this conduct has been stated as follows
by a contemporary writer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"An influential member of this meeting who had
abstained from the produce of slave labor came to the conclusion
that this action was the result of his own will. He
therefore became very sensitive and irritable touching references
to the slavery question, and very bitter against the
testimony of Elias Hicks. It is believed that this was one
of the causes which led to the affront of Elias Hicks in the
Pine Street Meeting aforesaid."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It was claimed in the famous New Jersey chancery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>
case<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> by the Orthodox Friends, that there was precedent
for adjourning a meeting while a visiting minister in proper
order was performing service in a co-ordinate branch of the
Society. Be that as it may, the weight of evidence warrants
the conclusion that the incident at Pine Street was intended
as an affront to Elias Hicks. The conservative elements in
Philadelphia had evidently made up their minds that the
time had come to visit their displeasure upon the Long
Island preacher.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_115_115" id="Footnote_115_115"></a><a href="#FNanchor_115_115"><span class="label">[115]</span></a> Foster's report, many times referred to in these pages, is a two-volume
work, containing the evidence and the exhibits in a case in
the New Jersey Court of Chancery. The examinations began Sixth
month 2, 1830, in Camden, N. J., before J. J. Foster, Master and Examiner
in Chancery, and continued from time to time, closing Fourth
month 13, 1831. The case was brought to determine who should possess
the school fund, of the Friends' School, at Crosswick, N. J. The
decision awarded the fund to the Orthodox.</p></div>

<p>The incident referred to above must have occurred in
the latter part of Tenth month. Elias says in his Journal,
after mentioning his arrival in Philadelphia: "We were at
two of their monthly meetings and their quarterly meeting."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
He makes no mention of the unpleasant occurrence.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_116_116" id="Footnote_116_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116_116"><span class="label">[116]</span></a> Journal, p. 382.</p></div>

<p>There seems to have been no further appearance of
trouble in the latitude of Philadelphia until Eighth month,
1822. This time opposition appeared in what was evidently
an irregular gathering of part of the Meeting for Sufferings.
At this meeting Jonathan Evans is reported to have said:
"I understand that Elias Hicks is coming on here on his
way to Baltimore Yearly Meeting. Friends know that he
preaches doctrines contrary to the doctrines of our Society;
that he has given uneasiness to his friends at home, and
they can't stop him, and unless we can stop him here he
must go on."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> This statement was only partially true, to
say the most possible for it. But a small minority of Elias'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span>
home meeting were in any way "uneasy" about him, whatever
may have been the character of his preaching. It
stands to reason that had there been a general and united
opposition to the ministry of Elias Hicks in his monthly
meeting or in the New York Yearly Meeting at any time
before the "separation," he could not have performed the
service involved in his religious visits. It will also appear
from the foregoing that the few opponents of Elias Hicks
on Long Island had evidently planned to invoke every
possible and conceivable influence, at the center of Quakerism
in Philadelphia, to silence this popular and well-known
preacher. At what point the influence so disposed became
of general effect in the polity of the Society only incidentally
belongs to the purpose of this book.</p>

<p>Out of the unofficial body<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> above mentioned, about a
dozen in number, a small and "select" committee was appointed.
The object was apparently to deal with Elias for
remarks said to have been made by him at New York
Yearly Meeting in Fifth month of that year, and reported
by Joseph Whitall.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_118_118" id="Footnote_118_118"></a><a href="#FNanchor_118_118"><span class="label">[118]</span></a> "Foster's Report," 1831, Vol. I. See testimony of Joseph Whitall,
p. 247. Also testimony of Abraham Lower, pp. 355-356.</p></div>

<p>The minute under which Elias performed the visit
referred to above was granted by his monthly meeting in
Seventh month, and he promptly set out on his visit with
David Seaman as his traveling companion. He spent nearly
three months visiting meetings in New Jersey and in Bucks,
Montgomery, Delaware and Chester Counties, Pennsylvania,
reaching Baltimore the 25th of Tenth month, where he
attended the Yearly Meeting. This appearance and
service in Philadelphia, he states very briefly, and with no
hint of the developing trouble, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We arrived in Philadelphia in the early part of <span class="correction" title="Originally: Twefth">Twelfth</span>
month, and I immediately entered on the arduous concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span>
which I had in prospect and which I was favored soon comfortably
to accomplish. We visited the families composing
Green Street Monthly Meeting, being in number one hundred
and forty, and we also attended that monthly meeting
and the monthly meeting for the Northern District. This
closed my visit here, and set me at liberty to turn my face
homeward."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_119_119" id="Footnote_119_119"></a><a href="#FNanchor_119_119"><span class="label">[119]</span></a> Journal, p. 394.</p></div>

<p>It will thus be seen that the charge of unsoundness was
entered in Philadelphia Meeting for Sufferings soon after
Elias started on his southern visit, but the matter was held
practically in suspense for four months. In the meantime
Elias was waited upon by a few elders, presumably in
accordance with the action of the Meeting for Sufferings
held in Eighth month. This opportunity was had when the
visitor passed through Philadelphia en route to Baltimore.
There is reason for believing that Elias succeeded in <span class="correction" title="Originally: measureably">measurably</span>
satisfying this small committee. But there was evidently
an element in Philadelphia that did not propose to
be satisfied.</p>

<p>In Twelfth month, when Elias arrived in Philadelphia
from his southern trip, and began his visits among the
families of Green Street Monthly Meeting, a meeting of the
elders of all the monthly meetings in the city was hastily
called. A deputation from the elders sought an "opportunity"
with Elias, and insisted that it be <i>private</i>.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> His position
was that he was not accountable to them for anything
he had said while traveling with a minute as a minister.
Elias finally consented, out of regard to some particular
Friends, to meet the elders in Green Street meeting-house,
provided witnesses other than the opposing elders could
be present. Among those who accompanied Elias were
John Comly, Robert Moore, John Moore and John Hunt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
When the meeting was held, however, the elders who
opposed Elias said they could not proceed, their reason being
that the gathering was not "select." In connection with
this controversy letters passed between the opposing parties.
One was signed by ten elders of Philadelphia, and is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To Elias Hicks</span>:</p>

<p>"Friends in Philadelphia having for a considerable time
past heard of thy holding and promulgating doctrines different
from and repugnant to those held by our religious
society, it was cause of uneasiness and deep concern to
them, as their sincere regard and engagement for the promotion
of the cause of Truth made it very desirable that all
the members of our religious society should move in true
harmony under the leading and direction of our blessed
Redeemer. Upon being informed of thy sentiments expressed
by Joseph Whitall&mdash;that Jesus Christ was not the
son of God until after the baptism of John and the descent
of the Holy Ghost, and that he was no more than a man;
that the same power that made Christ a Christian must
make us Christians; and that the same power that saved
Him must save us&mdash;many friends were affected therewith,
and some time afterward, several Friends being together in
the city on subjects relating to our religious society, they
received an account from Ezra Comfort of some of thy
expressions in the public general meeting immediately succeeding
the Southern Quarterly Meeting lately held in the
state of Delaware, which was also confirmed by his companion,
Isaiah Bell, that Jesus Christ was the first man who
introduced the gospel dispensation, the Jews being under
the outward or ceremonial law or dispensation, it was necessary
that there should be some outward miracle, as the
healing of the outward infirmities of the flesh and raising
the outward dead bodies in order to introduce the gospel
dispensation; He had no more power given Him than man,
for He was no more than man; He had nothing to do with
the healing of the soul, for that belongs to God only;
Elisha had the same power to raise the dead; that man
being obedient to the spirit of God in him could arrive at
as great, or a greater, degree of righteousness than Jesus
Christ; that 'Jesus Christ thought it not robbery to be equal
with God; neither do I think it robbery for man to be equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
with God'; then endeavored to show that by attending to
that stone cut out of the mountain without hands, or the
seed in man, it would make man equal with God, saying:
for that stone in man was the entire God. On hearing
which it appeared to Friends a subject of such great importance
and of such deep welfare to the interest of our
religious society as to require an extension of care, in order
that if any incorrect statement had been made it should as
soon as possible be rectified, or, if true, thou might be possessed
of the painful concerns of Friends and their sense
and judgment thereon. Two of the elders accordingly
waited on thee on the evening of the day of thy arriving in
the city, and although thou denied the statement, yet thy
declining to meet these two elders in company with those
who made it left the minds of Friends without relief. One
of the elders who had called on thee repeated his visit on the
next day but one, and again requested thee to see the two
elders and the Friends who made the above <span class="correction" title="Originally: statments">statements</span> which
thou again declined. The elders from the different Monthly
Meetings of the city were then convened and requested a
private opportunity with thee, which thou also refused, yet
the next day consented to meet them at a time and place of
thy own fixing; but, when assembled, a mixed company
being collected, the elders could not in this manner enter
into business which they considered of a nature not to be
investigated in any other way than in a select, private
opportunity. They, therefore, considered that meeting a
clear indication of thy continuing to decline to meet the
elders as by them proposed. Under these circumstances, it
appearing that thou art not willing to hear and disprove the
charges brought against thee, we feel it a duty to declare
that we cannot have religious unity with thy conduct nor
with the doctrines thou art charged with promulgating.</p>

<p>To this epistle Elias Hicks made the following reply,
two days having intervened:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To Caleb Pierce and other Friends:</span></p>

<p>"Having been charged by you with unsoundness of
principle and doctrine, founded on reports spread among
the people in an unfriendly manner, and contrary to the
order of our Discipline, by Joseph Whitall, as charged in
the letter from you dated the 19th instant, and as these
charges are not literally true, being founded on his own
forced and improper construction of my words, I deny them,
and I do not consider myself amenable to him, nor to any
other, for crimes laid to my charge as being committed in
the course of the sittings of our last Yearly Meeting, as not
any of my fellow-members of that meeting discovered or
noticed any such thing&mdash;which I presume to be the case, as
not an individual has mentioned any such things to me,
but contrary thereto. Many of our most valued Friends
(who had heard some of those foul reports first promulgated
by a citizen of our city) acknowledged the great satisfaction
they had with my services and exercise in the
course of that meeting, and were fully convinced that all
those reports were false; and this view is fully confirmed
by a certificate granted me by the Monthly and Quarterly
Meetings of which I am a member, in which they expressed
their full unity with me&mdash;and which meetings were held a
considerable time after our Yearly Meeting, in the course
of which Joseph Whitall has presumed to charge me with
unsoundness of doctrine, contrary to the sense of the
Monthly, Quarterly and Yearly Meetings of which I am a
member, and to whom only do I hold myself amenable for
all conduct transacted within their limits. The other
charges made against me by Ezra Comfort, as expressed in
your letter, are in general incorrect, as is proved by the
annexed certificate; and, moreover, as Ezra Comfort has
departed from gospel order in not mentioning his uneasiness
to me when present with me, and when I could have appealed
to Friends of that meeting to justify me; therefore,
I consider Ezra Comfort to have acted disorderly and contrary
to the discipline, and these are the reasons which induce
me to refuse a compliance with your requisitions&mdash;considering
them arbitrary and contrary to the established
order of our Society.</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Elias Hicks.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, Twelfth month 21, 1822."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>As already noted the charges in the letter of the ten
elders were based on statements made by Joseph Whitall,
supplemented by allegations by Ezra Comfort, as to what
Elias had said in two sermons, neither of which was delivered
within the bounds of Philadelphia <span class="correction" title="Originally: Quartely">Quarterly</span> Meeting.
The matters complained of are mostly subject to variable
interpretation, and scarcely afford a basis for a religious
quarrel, especially considering that the alleged statements
were at the best garbled from quite lengthy discourses.</p>

<p>On the same day that Elias replied to the ten elders,
three members of Southern Quarterly Meeting issued a
signed statement regarding the charges of Ezra Comfort.
It is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We, the undersigned, being occasionally in the city of
Philadelphia, when a letter was produced and handed us,
signed by ten of its citizens, Elders of the Society of
Friends, and directed to Elias Hicks, after perusing and
deliberately considering the charges therein against him,
for holding and propagating doctrines inconsistent with our
religious testimonies, and more especially those said by
Ezra Comfort and Isaiah Bell, to be held forth at a meeting
immediately succeeding the late Southern Quarterly Meeting,
and we being members of the Southern Quarter, and
present at the said meeting, we are free to state, for the
satisfaction of the first-mentioned Friends and all others
whom it may concern, that we apprehend the charges exhibited
by the two Friends named are without substantial
foundation; and in order to give a clear view we think it
best and proper here to transcribe the said charges exhibited
and our own understanding of the several, viz., 'That
Jesus Christ was the first man that introduced the Gospel
Dispensation, the Jews being under the outward and ceremonial
law or dispensation, it was necessary there should
be some outward miracles, as healing the outward infirmities
of the flesh and raising the outward dead bodies in
order to introduce the gospel dispensation;' this in substance
is correct. 'That he had no more power given him
than man,' this sentence is incorrect; and also, 'That he had
nothing to do with the healing of the soul, for that belongs
to God only,' is likewise incorrect; and the next sentence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span>
'That Elisha also had the same power to raise the dead'
should be transposed thus to give Elias's expressions. 'By
the same power it was that Elisha raised the dead.' 'That
man being obedient to the spirit of God in him could arrive
at as great or greater degree of righteousness than Jesus
Christ,' this is incorrect; 'That Jesus Christ thought it not
robbery to be equal with God,' with annexing the other part
of the paragraph mentioned by the holy apostle would be
correct. 'Neither do I think it robbery for man to be equal
with God' is incorrect. 'Then endeavouring to show that
by attending to that stone cut out of the mountain without
hands or the seed in man it would make men equal with
God' is incorrect; the sentence for that stone in man should
stand thus: 'That this stone or seed in man had all the
attributes of the divine nature that was in Christ and God.'
This statement and a few necessary remarks we make
without comment, save only that we were then of opinion
and still are that the sentiments and doctrines held forth
by our said friend, Elias Hicks, are agreeable to the opinions
and doctrines held by George Fox and other worthy Friends
of his time.</p>

<p>First month 4, 1823, the ten elders sent a final communication
to Elias Hicks, which we give in full:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the perusal of thy letter of the 21st of last month,
it was not a little affecting to observe the same disposition
still prevalent that avoided a select meeting with the elders,
which meeting consistently with the station we are placed
in and with the sense of duty impressive upon us, we were
engaged to propose and urge to thee as a means wherein
the cause of uneasiness might have been investigated, the
Friends who exhibited the complaint fully examined, and
the whole business placed in a clear point of view.</p>

<p>"On a subject of such importance the most explicit candour
and ingenuousness, with a readiness to hear and give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
complete satisfaction ought ever to be maintained; this the
Gospel teaches, and the nature of the case imperiously demanded
it. As to the certificate which accompanied thy
letter, made several weeks after the circumstances occurred,
it is in several respects not only vague and ambiguous,
but in others (though in different terms) it corroborates the
statement at first made. When we take a view of the whole
subject, the doctrines and sentiments which have been promulgated
by thee, though under some caution while in this
city, and the opinions which thou expressed in an interview
between Ezra Comfort and thee, on the 19th ult., we are
fully and sorrowfully confirmed in the conclusion that thou
holds and art disseminating principles very different from
those which are held and maintained by our religious
society.</p>

<p>"As thou hast on thy part closed the door against the
brotherly care and endeavours of the elders here for thy
benefit, and for the clearing our religious profession, this
matter appears of such serious magnitude, so interesting to
the peace, harmony, and well-being of society, that we think
it ought to claim the weighty attention of thy Friends at
home."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p></blockquote>

the previous letter, repeating them seems unnecessary.</p></div>

<p>One other communication closed the epistolary part of
the controversy for the time being. It was a letter issued
by twenty-two members of Southern Quarterly Meeting,
concerning the ministerial service of Elias Hicks, during
the meetings referred to in the charge of Ezra Comfort:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We, the subscribers, being informed that certain reports
have been circulated by Ezra Comfort and Isaiah Bell
that Elias Hicks had propagated unsound doctrine, at our
general meeting on the day succeeding our quarterly meeting
in the 11th month last, and a certificate signed by
Robert Moore, Joseph Turner and Joseph G. Rowland being
read contradicting said reports, the subject has claimed our
weighty and deliberate attention, and it is our united judgment
that the doctrines preached by our said Friend on the
day alluded to were the Truths of the Gospel, and that his
labours of love amongst us at our particular meetings as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
well as at our said quarterly meeting were united with by
all our members for aught that appears.</p>

<p>"And we believe that the certificate signed by the three
Friends above named is in substance a correct statement
of facts.</p>

<p>All of these communications, both pro and con, are
presented simply for what they are worth. When it comes
to determining what is or is not "unsound doctrine," we
are simply dealing with personal opinion, and not with
matters of absolute fact. This is especially true of a religious
body that had never attempted to define or limit its
doctrines in a written creed.</p>

<p>The attempt of the Philadelphia elders to deal in a
disciplinary way with Elias Hicks on the score of the
manner or matter of his preaching was pronounced by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>
friends a usurpation of authority. It was held that the
elders in question had no jurisdiction in the case, in proof
of which the following paragraph in the Discipline of the
Philadelphia Yearly Meeting was cited:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And our advice to all our ministers is that they be
frequent in reading the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments;
and if any in the course of their ministry shall misapply
or draw unsound inferences or wrong conclusions
from the text, or shall misbehave themselves in point of
conduct or conversation, let them be admonished in love
and tenderness by the elders or overseers where they
live."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p></blockquote>

Philadelphia, 1806, p. 62.</p></div>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that a certain amount of encouragement
came to the opponents of Elias Hicks in Philadelphia
from some Friends on Long Island, and from three
or four residents of Jericho, but they did not at that time
at least officially represent any meeting of Friends at
Jericho, either real or pretended. This far in the controversy
the aggressors were confined to those who at that
time were considered the "weight of the meeting," and who
at best represented only the so-called "select" meeting and
not the Society at large. At the beginning at least the
trouble was an affair of the ministers and elders. It later
affected the whole Society, by the efforts of the leaders on
both sides.</p>

<p>Incidents are not wanting to show that up to the very
end of the controversy the rank and file of Friends had
little vital interest in the matters involved in the trouble.
It is related on good authority that two prominent members
of Nine Partners Quarterly Meeting in Dutchess County,
New York, husband and wife, made a compact before
attending the meeting in Eighth month, 1828, feeling that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
the issue would reach its climax at that time. They agreed
that whichever side retained control of the organization and
the meeting-house would be considered by them the meeting,
and receive their support. We mention this as undoubtedly
representing the feeling in more than one case.
The fact that it took practically a decade of excitement and
manipulation, to create the antagonisms, personal and otherwise,
which resulted in an open rupture, shows how little
disposed the majority of Friends were to disrupt the
Society.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Time of Unsettlement.</p>


<p>Between the trouble related in the last chapter and
the culmination of the disturbance in the Society of Friends,
in 1827-1828, there was an interval of four or five years.
This period was by no means one of quiet. On the other
hand it was one of confusion, in the midst of which the
forces were at work, and the plans perfected which led
up logically to the end.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the last communication of
the Philadelphia elders sent to Elias Hicks was dated First
month 4, 1823. They had manifestly failed to silence the
preacher from Jericho, or to greatly alarm him with their
charges of heresy. Just eleven days after the epistle in
question was written, the Meeting for Sufferings of Philadelphia
Yearly Meeting assembled. This meeting issued a
singular document,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> said by the friends of Elias Hicks to
have been intended as a sort of "Quaker Creed," but this
was vigorously denied by those responsible for its existence.
The statement of doctrine, which was as follows, was duly
signed by Jonathan Evans, clerk, "on behalf of the meeting:"</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_125_125" id="Footnote_125_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_125_125"><span class="label">[125]</span></a> The title of the production was as follows: Extracts from the
Writings of Primitive Friends, concerning the Divinity of Our Lord
and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Published by the direction of the Meeting
for Sufferings, held in Philadelphia. Solomon W. Conrad, printer.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"At a Meeting for Sufferings held in Philadelphia the
17th of the First month, 1823, an essay containing a few
brief extracts from the writings of our primitive Friends
on several of the doctrines of the Christian religion, which
have been always held, and are most surely believed by us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
being produced and read; on solid consideration they
appeared so likely to be productive of benefit, if a publication
thereof was made and spread among our members
generally, that the committee appointed on the printing and
distribution of religious books are directed to have a sufficient
number of them struck off and distributed accordingly,
being as follows:</p>

<p>"We have always believed that the Holy Scriptures
were written by divine inspiration, that they are able to
make wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ
Jesus, for, as holy men of God spake as they were moved
by the Holy Ghost, they are therefore profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly
furnished unto all good works. But they are not or cannot
be subjected to the fallen, corrupt reason of man. We have
always asserted our willingness that all our doctrines be
tried by them, and admit it as a positive maxim that whatsoever
any do (pretending to the Spirit) which is contrary
to the Scriptures be accounted and judged a delusion of
the devil.</p>

<p>"We receive and believe in the testimony of the Scriptures
simply as it stands in the text. 'There are three that
bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy
Ghost, and these three are one.'</p>

<p>"We believe in the only wise, omnipotent and everlasting
God, the creator of all things in heaven and earth,
and the preserver of all that he hath made, who is God
over all blessed forever.</p>

<p>"The infinite and most wise God, who is the foundation,
root and spring of all operation, hath wrought all
things by his eternal Word and Son. This is that Word
that was in the beginning with God and was God, by whom
all things were made, and without whom was not anything
made that was made. Jesus Christ is the beloved and only
begotten Son of God, who, in the fulness of time, through
the Holy Ghost, was conceived and born of the Virgin
Mary; in him we have redemption through his blood, even
the forgiveness of sins. We believe that he was made a
sacrifice for sin, who knew no sin; that he was crucified for
us in the flesh, was buried and rose again the third day by
the power of his Father for our justification, ascended up
into heaven and now sitteth at the right hand of God.</p>

<p>"As then that infinite and incomprehensible Fountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
of life and motion operateth in the creatures by his own
eternal word and power, so no creature has access again
unto him but in and by the Son according to his own
blessed declaration, 'No man knoweth the Father but the
Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.' Again, 'I
am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto
the Father but by me.' Hence he is the only Mediator
between God and man for having been with God from all
eternity, being himself God, and also in time partaking of
the nature of man; through him is the goodness and love of
God conveyed to mankind, and by him again man receiveth
and partaketh of these mercies.</p>

<p>"We acknowledge that of ourselves we are not able to
do anything that is good, neither can we procure remission
of sins or justification by any act of our own, but acknowledge
all to be of and from his love, which is the original
and fundamental cause of our acceptance. 'For God so
loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
everlasting life.'</p>

<p>"We firmly believe it was necessary that Christ should
come, that by his death and sufferings he might offer up
himself a sacrifice to God for our sins, who his own self
bear our sins in his own body on the tree; so we believe
that the remission of sins which any partake of is only in
and by virtue of that most satisfactory sacrifice and <span class="correction" title="Originally: no">not</span>
otherwise. For it is by the obedience of that one that the
free gift is come upon all to justification. Thus Christ by
his death and sufferings hath reconciled us to God even
while we are enemies; that is, he offers reconciliation to
us, and we are thereby put into a capacity of being reconciled.
God is willing to be reconciled unto us and ready
to remit the sins that are past if we repent.</p>

<p>"Jesus Christ is the intercessor and advocate with the
Father in heaven, appearing in the presence of God for us,
being touched with a feeling of our infirmities, sufferings,
and sorrows; and also by his spirit in our hearts he maketh
intercession according to the will of God, crying abba,
Father. He tasted death for every man, shed his blood for
all men, and is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. He
alone is our Redeemer and Saviour, the captain of our salvation,
the promised seed, who bruises the serpent's head;
the alpha and omega, the first and the last. He is our
wisdom, righteousness, justification and redemption;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
neither is there salvation in any other, for there is no other
name under heaven given among men whereby we may be
saved.</p>

<p>"As he ascended far above all heavens that he might
fill all things, his fulness cannot be comprehended or contained
in any finite creature, but in some measure known
and experienced in us, as we are prepared to receive the
same, as of his fulness we have received grace for grace.
He is both the word of faith and a quickening spirit in us,
whereby he is the immediate cause, author, object and
strength of our living faith in his name and power, and of
the work of our salvation from sin and bondage of corruption.</p>

<p>"The Son of God cannot be divided from the least or
lowest appearance of his own divine light or life in us, no
more than the sun from its own light; nor is the sufficiency
of his light within set up or mentioned in opposition to
him, or to his fulness considered as in himself or without
us; nor can any measure or degree of light received from
Christ be properly called the fulness of Christ; or Christ
as in fulness, nor exclude him from being our complete
Saviour. And where the least degree or measure of this
light and life of Christ within is sincerely waited in, followed
and obeyed there is a blessed increase of light and
grace known and felt; as the path of the just it shines more
and more until the perfect day, and thereby a growing in
grace and in the knowledge of God and of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ hath been and is truly experienced.</p>

<p>"Wherefore we say that whatever Christ then did, both
living and dying, was of great benefit to the salvation of all
that have believed and now do and that hereafter shall
believe in him unto justification and acceptance with God;
but the way to come to that faith is to receive and obey
the manifestation of his divine light and grace in the conscience,
which leads men to believe and value and not to
disown or undervalue Christ as the common sacrifice and
mediator. For we do affirm that to follow this holy light
in the conscience and to turn our minds and bring all our
deeds and thoughts to it is the readiest, nay, the only right
way, to have true, living and sanctifying faith in Christ as
he appeared in the flesh; and to discern the Lord's body,
coming and sufferings aright, and to receive any real benefit
by him as our only sacrifice and mediator, according to the
beloved disciple's emphatical testimony, 'If we walk in the
light as he (God) is in the light we have fellowship one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his son
cleanseth us from all sin.'</p>

<p>"By the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ without us we,
truly repenting and believing, as through the mercy of
God, justified from the imputation of sins and transgressions
that are past, as though they had never been committed;
and by the mighty work of Christ within us the
power, nature and habits of sin are destroyed; that as sin
once reigned unto death even so now grace reigneth
through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This deliverance is almost as theological and dogmatic
as the Westminster Confession. It scarcely contains a
reference to the fundamental doctrine of George Fox. It
is not too much to say that if it was the belief of the
"primitive" Friends, there was little reason, touching points
of doctrine, for the preaching of Fox, or the first gathering
of the Society. All the ground covered by this doctrinal
statement was amply treated in the Articles of Religion of
the Church of England, and the Confession of the
Presbyterians.</p>

<p>The above document was issued without quotation
marks, or any indication as to what "primitive" Friends
were responsible for the sentiments contained in its various
parts. By careful examination it will be seen that one
sentence, at least, is from Barclay's Apology, "but it proves
to be a garbled quotation." We refer to the following
sentence in the second paragraph in the above article, relating
to the Scriptures: "But they are not or cannot be
subjected to the fallen, corrupt reason of man." Barclay's
complete statement is here given:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Yet, as the proposition itself concludeth, to the last
part of which I now come, it will not from thence follow
that these divine revelations are to be subjected to the
examination either of the outward testimony of Scripture
or of the human or natural reason of man, as to a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
noble and certain rule or touchstone; for the divine revelation
and inward illumination is that which is evident by
itself, forcing the well-disposed understanding and irresistibly
moving it to assent by its own evidence and clearness,
even as the common principles of natural truths to
bend the mind to a natural assent."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p></blockquote>

Street, Philadelphia, 1877, p. 68.</p></div>

<p>It will be seen clearly that the reference in the document
issued by the Meeting for Sufferings was not only a misquotation
from Barclay, but also misrepresented his meaning.
The latter is particularly true if we refer to the top
of the same page that contains the above extract, where he
says: "So would I not have any reject or doubt the
certainty of that unerring Spirit which God hath given his
children as that which can alone guide them into all truth,
because some have falsely pretended to it."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> It will thus
appear clear that Elias Hicks, and not the Meeting for
Sufferings, was supported by Barclay.</p>

<p>The reference in the third paragraph in the foregoing
"declaration" to the "three that bear record in heaven" is
a quotation from 1 John 5:7. It is entirely omitted from
the Revised Version, and thorough scholars in the early
years of the nineteenth century were convinced that the
passage was an interpolation.</p>

<p>The statement of belief prepared by the Meeting for
Sufferings was not approved by the Yearly Meeting, so nothing
was really accomplished by the compilation, if such it
was.</p>

<p>Considering the order of the events recorded, it is hard
not to conceive that the attempt to promulgate a "declaration
of faith" by the Yearly Meeting was really intended for
personal application to Elias Hicks. Had the plan succeeded,
the elders could easily have attempted to silence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span>
Jericho preacher in Philadelphia, on the ground that he was
"unsound" touching the doctrine promulgated by the Yearly
Meeting.</p>

<p>The task of detailing all of the doings of this period
would be too difficult and distasteful to be fully recorded in
this book. That the unfriendly conduct was by no means
all on one side is painfully true. Still, as the determination
of the Philadelphia elders to deal with Elias Hicks, and
stop his ministry if possible, was continued, the effort cannot
be ignored.</p>

<p>In First month, 1825, the elders presented a charge of
unsoundness against Elias Hicks in the Preparative Meeting
of Ministers and Elders, the intent being to have the
charge forwarded to the monthly meeting, but this action
was not taken. With phenomenal persistence one of the
elders introduced the subject in the monthly meeting, and
secured the appointment of a committee to investigate the
merits of the case. This committee made a report unfavorable
to Elias Hicks, which report, his friends claimed
was improperly entered on the minutes. A vigorous, but
by no means a united effort was made to get this report
forwarded to Jericho Monthly Meeting, but this failed.
One of the incidents of this attempt against Elias Hicks was
the disownment of a member of the Northern District
Monthly Meeting, for remarks made in Western District
Monthly Meeting. The report of the committee against
Elias was under consideration, when the visitor arose and
said: "If it be understood by the report&mdash;if it set forth and
declare, that Elias Hicks, the last time he was in this house,
preached doctrines contrary to the Holy Scriptures, or contrary
to our first or primitive Friends, being present at that
time, I stand here as a witness that it is utterly false."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
Although this Friend was disowned by his monthly meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>ing
he was reinstated by the Quarterly Meeting. It should
be said that the report of unsoundness referred to, contained
this specific charge: "We apprehend that Elias
Hicks expressed sentiments inconsistent with the Holy
Scriptures, and the religious principles our Society has held
from its first rise."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The trouble in Philadelphia was renewed in an aggravated
form in First month, 1827, when Elias Hicks appeared
in the city on another religious visit. Of course
the atmosphere had been charged with all sorts of attacks
regarding the venerable preacher. Under such conditions
no special advertising was necessary to get a crowd. The
populace was curious, not a few wanted to hear and see,
for themselves, this man about whom so many charges had
been made. As a matter of course the meeting-houses
were crowded beyond their capacity. It was alleged by
Orthodox Friends that the meetings were disorderly, which
may have been literally true. But the tumult was increased
by injecting an element of controversy, into the First-day
afternoon meeting in Western meeting-house, on the part
of an Orthodox elder. All the evidence goes to show that
Elias attempted to quiet the tumult. He seems to have been
willing to accord liberty of expression to his opponents.
The matter was taken into Western Monthly Meeting, a
committee entering the following charge: "That a large
and disorderly concourse of people were brought together,
at an unseasonable hour, and under circumstances that
strongly indicated a design to preoccupy the house to the
exclusion of most of the members of our meeting, and to
suppress in a riotous manner any attempt that might be
made to maintain the doctrine and principles of our religious
society, in opposition to the views of Elias Hicks."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span></p></div>

<p>The literal truthfulness of this charge in every particular
may be at least mildly questioned. It must be remembered
that of the Friends in Philadelphia at that time, the
Orthodox were a minority of about one to three. The
majority of Friends felt that much of the trouble was personal,
and they undoubtedly flocked to hear the traduced
preacher. The outside crowd that came could not rightfully
or wisely have been kept from attending public meetings.
Both parties had been sowing to the wind, and
neither could validly object to the whirlwind that inevitably
came. Still Western Monthly Meeting proposed to deal
with a visiting minister from another yearly meeting, on
points of doctrine, and there can be little doubt that arbitrary
proceedings of this sort had quite as much, if not
more, to do with kindling the fires of "separation," as the
preaching of Elias Hicks.</p>

<p>Rapidly the trouble ran back to the opposition raised
by the elders in 1822. Eventually Green Street Monthly
Meeting became the center of Society difficulty. It will be
remembered that in the year last written that monthly meeting
had enjoyed a family visitation from Elias Hicks, and
had subsequently given him a minute of approval. After
this one of the elders, who acquiesced in this action, joined
the other nine in written disapproval of Elias Hicks. The
major portion of the monthly meeting proposed to take
the inconsistent conduct of this elder under care, and the
matter was handed over to the overseers. In thus hastily
invoking the discipline, Green Street Monthly Meeting made
an apparent error of judgment, even admitting that the
spirit of the transaction was not censurable. This brought
the Quarterly Meeting of Ministers and Elders precipitously
into the case. Finally Green Street Monthly Meeting released
the Friend in question from his station as elder. A
question arose on which there was a sharp discussion as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>
whether elders were independent of the overseers in the
exercise of their official duties. A long line of conduct followed,
finally resulting in the Quarterly Meeting of
Ministers and Elders sending a report to the general
quarterly meeting, amounting to a remonstrance against
Green Street Monthly Meeting. This appeared to be a
violation of Discipline, which said: "None of the said
meetings of ministers and elders are in anywise to interfere
with the business of any meeting for discipline."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> These
matters, with the remonstrance of the released Green Street
elder, would therefore seem to have been irregularly brought
before the quarterly meeting. It was claimed by the friends
of Elias Hicks that he had broken no rule of discipline; that
the charge, that he held "sentiments inconsistent with the
Scriptures, and the principles of Friends," was vague as to
its matter, and purely personal as to the manner of its circulation.
Up to this point it should be remembered, the
controversy was almost entirely centered on Elias Hicks.</p>

Philadelphia, 1806, p. 67.</p></div>

<p>This matter dragged along, a source of constant disturbance,
appearing in perhaps a new form in the Quarterly
Meeting of Ministers and Elders in Eighth month, 1826.
The immediate action involved appointing a committee to
assist the Preparative Meeting of Ministers and Elders of
Green Street Monthly Meeting, the assumed necessity in
the case being the reported unsoundness of a Green Street
minister, a charge to this effect having been preferred by
one member only. The situation, however, caused an abatement
in answering the query relating to love and unity.
While these transactions were going on among the ministers
and elders, Green Street Monthly Meeting took action which
removed two of its elders from that station in the Society.
The two deposed elders took their grievances to the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span>
quarterly meeting. While the quarterly meeting would not
listen to a statement of grievances, yet a committee to go
over the whole case was appointed. The committee thus
appointed, without waiting any action by the quarterly meeting,
transformed the removal of the aggrieved elders into
an appeal, and then demanded that Green Street Monthly
Meeting turn over to that committee all the minutes relating
to the case of the two elders. This the Green Street Meeting
refused to do. Although the case had never been before
the quarterly meeting, the committee of inquiry reported
to the full meeting, that all of the action of Green
Street Monthly Meeting relating to the two elders should
be annulled. It was claimed that, by virtue of the leadership
which the Orthodox had in the quarterly meeting, a
precedent had been established which gave committees the
right to exceed the power conferred upon them by the meeting
which appointed them. The committee had not been
appointed to decide a case, but to investigate a complaint.</p>

<p>Following this experience, after much wrangling, and
in the midst of manifest disunity, and against what it was
claimed was the manifest opposition of the major portion
of the meeting, the quarterly meeting in Eleventh month,
1826, appointed a committee to visit the monthly meetings.
This committee was manifestly one-sided, but could have no
possible disciplinary service from extending brotherly care.
Nevertheless at the quarterly meeting in Fifth month, 1827,
this committee, for presumed gospel labor, reported that the
large Green Street Monthly Meeting should be laid down,
and its members attached to the Northern District Monthly
Meeting. It is not necessary to enter into any argument
as to the right of a quarterly meeting, under our system, to
lay down an active monthly meeting, without that meeting's
consent. The laying down of Green Street Monthly Meeting
followed, the "separation" in the yearly meeting. It
should be said that in Second month, 1827, Green Street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
Monthly Meeting, attempted to secure consent from the
quarterly meeting to transfer itself to Abington Quarterly
Meeting, and subsequently this was done.</p>

<p>The claim was made, and with some show of reason,
that the various lines of conduct taken against Green Street
Monthly Meeting, were incited by a desire to punish this
meeting for its friendly interest in Elias Hicks.</p>

<p>We are rapidly approaching the point where the Society
troubles in Philadelphia ceased to directly relate to
Elias Hicks. It will be remembered that there was trouble
touching the preaching of Elias coming by way of Southern
Quarterly Meeting in 1822. The facts indicate that a majority
of that meeting was quite content to let matters rest.
It seems, however, that two members of the Meeting for
Sufferings from that quarter had misrepresented their constituency
in the Hicks controversy. Therefore in 1826
that quarterly meeting discontinued the service of the two
members of the Meeting for Sufferings, supplying their
places with new appointments. This action was objected
to by the full meeting, the majority holding that members
could not have their service discontinued by the constituent
bodies which appointed them. An attempt was made to
convince Southern Quarterly Meeting that it was improper
and illegal to appoint new representatives, if the old ones
were willing to serve. It was also claimed that it was
"never intended to release the representatives from a
quarterly meeting to the Meeting for Sufferings, except at
their own request."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Surely the Discipline then operative
gave no warrant for such an inference.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Assuming that
the above contention was valid, the Meeting for Sufferings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>
would simply have become a small hierarchy in the Society,
never to be dissolved, except at its own request.</p>

<p>It would seem, however, that the rules governing the
Meeting for Sufferings were especially made to guard
against just such an exercise of power as has been mentioned.
The Discipline under the heading, "Meeting for
Sufferings," contained this provision: "The said meeting
is not to meddle with any matter of faith or discipline,
which has not been determined by the yearly meeting."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>

by the yearly meeting, and when that failed, how

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Three Sermons Reviewed.</p>


<p>We have reached the point where it would seem in
order to consider the matter contained in some of the sermons
preached by Elias Hicks, in order to determine, if we
can, what there was about the matter or the manner of
his ministry, which contributed to the controversy, personal
and theological, which for several years disturbed the
Society of Friends.</p>

<p>The trouble was initiated, and for some time agitated,
by comparatively few people. Two or three Friends began
talking about what Elias said, from memory. Later they
took long-hand notes of his sermons, in either case using
isolated and disconnected sentences and expressions. Taken
from their association with the balance of the sermon, and
passed from mouth to mouth by critics, they assumed an exaggerated
importance, and stood out boldly as centers of
controversy.</p>

<p>All of the evidence goes to show that little attempt was
made to give printed publicity to these discourses, until the
preacher had been made famous by the warmth and extent of
the controversy over the character of his preaching.</p>

<p>A volume of twelve sermons preached by Elias Hicks
at various points in Pennsylvania in 1824 was published the
following year in Philadelphia by Joseph and Edward
Parker. These discourses were taken in short-hand by
Marcus T. C. Gould. Two years later, in 1827, Gould began
the publication of "The Quaker," which contained sermons
by Elias, and a few other ministers in the Society.
In his advertisement of the first volume of this publication,
after stating the fact of the controversy which was rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span>
dividing the Society of Friends in two contending parties,
Gould says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At this important crisis, the reporter and proprietor of
the following work was employed by the joint consent of
both parties, to record in meeting the speeches of the individual
whose doctrines were by some pronounced sound,
and by others unsound. Since that period he has continued
to record the language of the same speaker, and others who
stand high as ministers in the Society, and the members
have continued to read his reports, as the only way of
arriving at the truth, in relation to discourses which were
variously represented."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not our purpose in this chapter to give sermons
or parts of sermons in detail. On the other hand, to simply
review a few of these discourses as samples, because at the
time of their delivery they called out opposition from Orthodox
Friends. It may be fairly inferred that they contained
in whole or in part the points of doctrinal offending in the
estimation of the critics of Elias Hicks.</p>

<p>The first of the series of sermons especially under review,
was delivered in the Pine Street meeting house, Philadelphia,
Twelfth month 10, 1826. At the conclusion of this
sermon Jonathan Evans arose, and spoke substantially as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I believe it to be right for me to say, that our Society
has always believed in the atonement, mediation, and intercession
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ&mdash;that by him
all things were created, in heaven and in earth, both visible
and invisible, whether they be thrones, principalities, or
powers.</p>

<p>"We believe that all things were created by him, and
for him; and that he was before all things, and that by him
all things consist. And any doctrine which goes to invalidate
these fundamental doctrines of the Christian religion
we cannot admit, nor do we hold ourselves accountable
for.</p>

<p>"Great efforts are making to make the people believe
that Jesus Christ was no more than a man, but we do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>
believe any such thing, nor can we receive any such doctrine,
or any thing which goes to inculcate such an idea.</p>

<p>"We believe him to be King of kings, and Lord of
lords, before whose judgment seat every soul shall be arraigned
and judged by him. We do not conceive him to
be a mere man; and we therefore desire, that people may
not suppose that we hold any such doctrines, or that we
have any unity with them."</p>

<p>Isaac Lloyd said: "I unite with Jonathan Evans&mdash;we
never have believed that our blessed Lord and Saviour,
Jesus Christ, came to the Jews only; for he was given for
God's salvation, to the ends of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_136_136" id="Footnote_136_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_136_136"><span class="label">[136]</span></a> "The Quaker," Vol. I, p. 72.</p></div>

<p>To these doctrinal statements Elias Hicks added: "I
have spoken; and I leave it for the people to judge&mdash;I do
not assume the judgment seat."</p>

<p>It may be informing in this connection to examine this
sermon somewhat in detail, to see if we can find the definite
doctrine which aroused the public opposition. The text
was, "Let love be without dissimulation." Having declared
that there could be no agreement between hatred and love;
and that love could not promote discord, he indulged in what
may be called a spiritual figure of speech, declaring that a
Christian must be in the same life, and live with the same
blood that Christ did, making the following explanation:
"As the support of the animal life is the blood; so it is with
the soul: the breath of life which God breathed into it is the
blood of the soul; the life of the soul; and in this sense we
are to understand it, and in no other sense."</p>

<p>He referred to the reprover of our sins, said that it is
God who reproves us. "Now, here is the great business of
our lives," he remarked, "not only to know this reprover,
but to know that it is a gift from God, a manifestation of
His own pure life, that was in his son Jesus Christ." Continuing
he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span></p><blockquote>

<p>"As the apostle testifies: 'In him was life, and the life
was the light of men; and that was the true light, which
lighteth every man that cometh into the world.' Now can
we hesitate a single moment, in regard to the truth of this
declaration? No sensible, reflecting mind can possibly do
it."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_137_137" id="Footnote_137_137"></a><a href="#FNanchor_137_137"><span class="label">[137]</span></a> "The Quaker," Vol. I, p. 51.</p></div>

<p>Touching the outward and written as compared with
the inner law of life, he affirmed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Here is a law more comprehensive than the law of
Moses, and it is clear to every individual of us, as the law
was to the Israelites. For I dare not suppose that the
Almighty would by any means make it a doubtful or mysterious
one. It would not become God at all to suppose
this the case&mdash;it would be casting a deep reflection upon his
goodness and wisdom. Therefore I conceive that the law
written in the heart, if we attend to it and do not turn from
it to build up traditions, or depend on anything that arises
from self, or that is in our own power, but come to be regulated
by this law, we shall see that it is the easiest thing
to be understood that can be, and that all our benefits depend
on our complying with this law.</p>

<p>"Here now we see what tradition is. It is a departure
from this law; and it has the same effect now that tradition
had upon the followers of the outward law; as a belief in
tradition was produced they were bound by it, and trusted
in it. And so people, nowadays, seem to be compelled
to believe in tradition, and thus they turn away from the
gospel dispensation, or otherwise the light and life of God's
Spirit in the soul, which is the law of the new covenant; for
the law is light and the commandment a lamp to show us
the way to life."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_138_138" id="Footnote_138_138"></a><a href="#FNanchor_138_138"><span class="label">[138]</span></a> "The Quaker," Vol. I, p. 51.</p></div>

<p>Using the term, "washed clean in the blood of the
lamb," he proceeded to explain himself as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And what is the blood of the lamb? It was his life,
my friends; for as outward, material blood was made use
of to express the animal life, inspired men used it as a
simile. Outward blood is the life of the animal, but it has
nothing to do with the soul; for the soul has no animal
blood, no material blood. The life of God in the soul is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>
the blood of the soul, and the life of God is the blood of
God; and so it was the life and blood of Jesus Christ his
son. For he was born of the spirit of his heavenly Father,
<i>and swallowed up fully and completely in his divine nature,
so that he was completely divine</i>. It was this that operated,
in that twofold state, and governed the whole animal
man which was the son of Abraham and David&mdash;a tabernacle
for his blessed soul. Here now we see that flesh and
blood are not capable of being in reality divine; for are they
not altogether under the direction and guidance of the soul?
Thus the animal body of Jesus did nothing but what the
divine power in the soul told it to do. Here he was
swallowed up in the divinity of his Father while here on
earth, and it was this that was the active thing, the active
principle, that governed the animate earth. For it corresponds,
and cannot do otherwise, with Almighty goodness,
that the soul should have power to command the animal
body to do good or evil; because he has placed us in this
probationary state, and in his wisdom has set evil and good
before us&mdash;light and darkness. He has made us free
agents, and given us opportunity to make our own election.</p>

<p>"Here now we shall see what is meant by election, the
election of God. We see that those who choose the Lord
for their portion and the God of Jacob for the lot of their
inheritance, these are the elect. And nothing ever did or
can elect a soul to God, but in this choice."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p>It is not easy to see how any one can impartially consider
the foregoing, especially the words printed in <i>italics</i>,
and continue to claim that Elias Hicks denied the divinity
of Christ. Near the end of this sermon we find the following
paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I say, dearly beloved, my soul craves it for us, that
we may sink down and examine ourselves; according to the
declaration of the apostle: 'Examine yourselves whether
ye be in the faith; prove your own selves; know ye not
your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you except ye
be reprobates?' Now we cannot suppose that the apostle
meant that outward man that walked about the streets of
Jerusalem; because he is not in any of us. But what is
this Jesus Christ? He came to be a Saviour to that na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>tion,
and was limited to that nation. He came to gather
up, and look up the lost sheep of the house of Israel. But
as he was a Saviour in the outward sense, so he was an
outward shadow of good things to come; and so the work
of the man, Jesus Christ, was a figure. He healed the sick
of their outward calamities&mdash;he cleansed the leprosy&mdash;all
of which was external and affected only their bodies&mdash;as
sickness does not affect the souls of the children of men,
though they may labour under all these things. But as he
was considered a Saviour, he meant by what he said, a
Saviour is within you, the anointing of the spirit of God is
within you; for this made the ways of Jesus so wonderful
in his day that the Psalmist in his prophecy concerning him
exclaims: 'Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity;
therefore God, even thy God hath anointed thee with
the oil of gladness above thy fellows.' He had loved righteousness,
you perceive, and therefore was prepared to receive
the fullness of the spirit, the fullness of that divine
anointing; for there was no germ of evil in him or about
him; both his soul and body were pure. He was anointed
above all his fellows, to be the head of the church, the top
stone, the chief corner stone, elect and precious. And
what was it that was a Saviour? Not that which was outward;
it was not flesh and blood; for 'flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of heaven'; it must go to the earth
from whence it was taken. It was that life, that same life
that I have already mentioned, that was in him, and which
is the light and life of men, and which lighteth every man,
and consequently every woman, that cometh into the world.
And we have this light and life in us; which is what the
apostle meant by Jesus Christ; and if we have not this ruling
in us we are dead, because we are not under the law of
the spirit of life. For the 'law is light and the reproofs of
instruction the way to life.'"<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Unless the so-called heterodox doctrine can be found
in the foregoing extracts, it does not exist in the sermon
under discussion.</p>

<p>Two other sermons were evidently both considered offensive
and objectionable by the orthodox. One was
preached at the Twelfth Street meeting, Twelfth month 10,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
1826, and the other the 12th of the same month at Key's
Alley, both in Philadelphia. At the Twelfth Street meeting,
amid much confusion, Thomas Wistar attempted to
controvert what Elias Hicks had said in certain particulars.
While this Friend was talking, Elias tried to persuade the
audience to be quiet.</p>

<p>At Key's Alley, when Elias had finished, Philadelphia
Pemberton, in the midst of a disturbance that nearly
drowned his voice, gave an exhortation in support of the
outward and vicarious atonement. When Friend Pemberton
ceased, Elias Hicks expressed his ideas regarding gospel
order and variety in the ministry, for which Friends had
always stood, in which he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My dear friends, God is a God of order&mdash;and it will do
me great pleasure to see this meeting sit quiet till it closes.
We have, and claim gospel privileges, and that every one
may be persuaded in his own mind; and as we have gifts
differing, so ought every one to have an opportunity to
speak, one by one, but not two at once, that all may be comforted.
If any thing be revealed (and we are not to speak
except this is the case), if any thing be revealed to one,
let others hold their peace&mdash;this is according to order.
And I desire it, once for all, my dear friends, if you love
me, that you will keep strictly to this order: it will be a
great comfort to my spirit."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_141_141" id="Footnote_141_141"></a><a href="#FNanchor_141_141"><span class="label">[141]</span></a> "The Quaker," Vol. I, p. 125.</p></div>

<p>Speaking of the fear of God, he said that he did not
mean "a fear that arises from the dread of torment, or
of chastisement, or anything of this kind; for that may be
no more than the fear of devils, for they, we read, believe
and tremble." His theory was that fear must be based on
knowledge, and the fear to displease God is not because of
what he may do to us, but what, for want of this knowledge,
we lose.</p>

<p>Again, he practically repeated what was evidently con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span>sidered
a truism: "My friends, we are not to look for a
law in our neighbor's heart, nor in our neighbor's book; but
we are to look for that law which is to be our rule and
guide, in our consciences, in our souls; for the law is whole
and perfect." Continuing he remarked:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now, how concordant this is with the testimony of
Jesus, when he queried with his disciples in this wise:
'Whom do men say that I the son of man am?' They
enumerated several characters, according to the views of
the people in that day. But until we come to this inward,
divine law, we shall know nothing rightly of that manifestation;
for none of us have seen him, nor any of his
works which he acted outwardly. But here we find some
are guessing, one way, and some another way, till they become
cruel respecting different opinions about him, insomuch
that they will kill and destroy each other for their
opinions. This is the effect of men's turning away from
the true light, the witness for God in their own souls; it
throws them into anarchy and confusion."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the opinion of Elias Hicks, it was not the man Peter
that was to constitute the rock upon which the church was
to be built, but rather the inner revelation, which enabled
the disciple to know that the Master was the Christ. "When
a true Christian comes to this rock, he comes to know it,
as before pointed out; and here every one must see, when
they build on this divine rock, this revealed will of our
Heavenly Father, there is no fear."</p>

<p>Touching the vital matters of salvation, we make the
following extracts from this sermon:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nothing but that which is begotten in every soul can
manifest God to the soul. You must know this for yourselves,
as nothing which you read in the Scriptures can
give you a sense of his saving and almighty power. Now,
the only begotten is what the power of God begets in the
soul, by the soul uniting with the visitations of divine love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
It becomes like a union&mdash;the soul submits and yields itself
up to God and the revelation of his power, and thus it becomes
wedded to him as its heavenly husband. Here, now,
is a birth of the Son of God; and this must be begotten in
every soul, as God can be manifested by nothing else.</p>

<p>"Now, what was this Holy Ghost and spirit of truth,
and where are we to find it? He did not leave his disciples
in the dark&mdash;'He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.'
Mind it, my friends. What a blessed sovereign God this
is to <span class="correction" title="Originally: be the">be to the</span> children of men&mdash;a God who has placed a portion
of himself in every rational soul&mdash;a measure of his
grace sufficient for every purpose, for the redemption of the
souls of men from sin and transgression, and to lead them
to the kingdom of heaven. And there is no other way.
Then do not put it off any longer; do not procrastinate any
longer; do not say to-morrow, but immediately turn inward,
for the day calls aloud for it&mdash;everything around us calls
for us to turn inward, to that which will help us to do the
great work of our salvation."<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There seems to have been little, if any, public demonstration
against the preaching of Elias Hicks in meetings
where he was present, except in Philadelphia. That is especially
true before the coming of the English preachers, and
the strained conditions that existed just preceding and during
the various acts of separation. It will thus be seen
that the concern and purpose of the ten men elders of Philadelphia
remained persistent until the end.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Braithwaite Controversy.</p>


<p>One of the marked incidents during the "separation"
period was the controversy between Elias Hicks and Anna
Braithwaite,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and the still more pointed discussion indulged
in by the friends and partisans of these two Friends. From
our viewpoint there seems to have been a certain amount
of unnecessary sensitiveness, which led both these Friends
to exalt to the dignity of an insult, and positive impeachment
of integrity, matters which probably belonged in the
domain of misunderstanding. It was apparently impossible
for either to think in the terms of the other, and so the contest
went on and ended.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_144_144" id="Footnote_144_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144_144"><span class="label">[144]</span></a> Anna Braithwaite, daughter of Charles and Mary Lloyd, of Birmingham,
England, was born Twelfth month, 1788. She was married
to Isaac Braithwaite, Third month 26, 1809, and removed to Kendal
immediately after. She sailed for America on her first visit, Seventh
month 7th, 1823. She attended three meetings in New York, and then
the Quarterly Meeting at Burlington, at which place she seems to have
been the guest of Stephen Grellet. She made two other visits to
America, one in 1825 and the other in 1827. She returned to England
after her first visit to America in the autumn of 1824. The last two
visits she made to America she was accompanied by her husband. Anna
Braithwaite was a woman of commanding presence, and was unusually
cultured for one of her sex at that time. She was something of a
linguist, speaking several languages. Her visits in America were quite
extensive, taking her as far south as North Carolina. She died Twelfth
month 18th, 1859.</p></div>

<p>We shall let her friends state the beginning and progress
of Anna Braithwaite's religious labor in America, and
quote as follows: "She arrived in New York in Eighth
month, 1823. For seven months she met with no opposition.
True, she always preached orthodox doctrines, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>
she had made no pointed allusions to the reputed sentiments
of Elias Hicks."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

Being reply to Pamphlet entitled, "The Misrepresentations of Anna
Braithwaite in Relation to the Doctrines Preached by Elias Hicks,"
etc., p. 2.</p></div>

<p>It is interesting to note that the positive preaching of
"orthodox doctrine," on its merits, caused no opposition,
even from the friends of Elias Hicks, the trouble only
coming when a personal application was made, amounting
to personal criticism. This is a fine testimony to the ministerial
liberty in the Society, and really a confirmation of
the claim that spiritual unity, and not doctrinal uniformity,
was the true basis of fellowship among Friends. We quote
again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"She visited Long Island in the spring, and had some
opportunities of conversing with Elias Hicks on religious
subjects, and also of hearing him preach. They differed
widely in sentiment, upon important doctrines, and she
soon had to conclude that his were at variance with the
hitherto well-established principles of the Society. With
these views, she returned to New York, and, subsequently,
about the time of the Yearly Meeting, in May, she considered
it an act of duty to warn her hearers against certain
specious doctrines, which were gradually spreading,
and undermining what she believed to be the 'true
faith.'"<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p>It seems that Anna Braithwaite was twice the guest of
Elias Hicks in Jericho, dining at his house both times. The
first visit was in First month, 1824, and the other in Third
month of the same year. They were both good talkers,
and apparently expressed themselves with commendable
frankness. The subject-matter of these two conversations,
however, became material around which a prolonged controversy
was waged. Before Anna Braithwaite sailed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span>
England, she wrote a letter to an unnamed Friend in Flushing
relative to the interviews with Elias Hicks. The letter
was dated Seventh month 16, 1824.</p>

<p>After Anna Braithwaite's departure from this country,
the letter referred to, with "Remarks in Reply to Assertions
of Elias Hicks," was published and extensively circulated.
It bore the following imprint: "Philadelphia: Printed for
the Reader, 1824."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> In this collection was a letter from
Ann Shipley, of New York, dated Tenth month 15, 1824,
in which she declares she was present "during the conversation
between her [Anna Braithwaite] and Elias Hicks.
The statement she left was correct." While Ann Shipley's
letter was published without her consent, it seemed to
fortify the Braithwaite statement, and both were extensively
used in an attempt to cast theological odium on the
venerable preacher. The possibility that both women might
have misunderstood or misinterpreted Elias Hicks does not
seem to have entered the minds of the Anti-Hicks partisans.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_147_147" id="Footnote_147_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147_147"><span class="label">[147]</span></a> Most of the controversial pamphlets and articles of the "separation"
period were anonymous. Except when the articles were printed in
regular periodicals, their publishers were as unknown as their authors.</p></div>

<p>This particular epistle of Anna Braithwaite does not
contain much material not to be found in a subsequent letter
with "notes," which will receive later treatment. In her
letter she habitually speaks of herself in the third person,
and makes this observation: "When at Jericho in the Third
month A. B. took tea with E. H. in a social way. She had
not been long in the house, when he began to speak on the
subject of the trinity, which A. B. considers a word so
grossly abused as to render it undesirable even to make use
of it."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> One cannot well suppress the remark that if a
like tenacity of purpose regarding other theological terms
had been held and followed by all parties to the controversy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
the history of the Society of Friends would have been
entirely different from the way it now has to be written.</p>

<p>Touching the two visits to Elias Hicks, we have direct
testimony from the visitor. We quote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I thought on first entering the house, my heart and
flesh would fail, but after a time of inexpressible conflict,
I felt a consoling belief that best help would be near, and
I think that every opposing thing was in a great measure
kept down.... He listened to my views, which I was
enabled to give with calmness. He was many times
brought into close quarters; but when he could not answer
me directly, he turned to something else. My mind is sorrowfully
affected on this subject, and the widespread mischief
arising from the propagation of such sentiments."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

p. 129-130.</p></div>

<p>In another letter, written to her family, she thus
referred to her interview with Elias Hicks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have reason to think that, notwithstanding the firm
and honest manner in which my sentiments were expressed,
an open door is left for further communication. We met in
love and we parted in love. He wept like a child for some
time before we separated; so that it was altogether a most
affecting opportunity."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_150_150" id="Footnote_150_150"></a><a href="#FNanchor_150_150"><span class="label">[150]</span></a> The same, p. 140.</p></div>

<p>While these two Friends undoubtedly were present in
the same meeting during the subsequent visits of Anna
Braithwaite to this country, their relations became so
strained that they never met on common Friendly ground
after the two occasions mentioned.</p>

<p>After the publication of the communication and comments
referred to, Elias Hicks wrote a long letter to his
friend, Dr. Edwin A. Atlee, of Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> This letter
became the subject of a good deal of controversy, and may
have been the exciting cause of a letter which Anna Braith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>waite
wrote Elias Hicks on the 13th of Eleventh month,
1824, from Lodge Lane, near Liverpool. This letter, with
elaborate "notes," was published and widely circulated on
this side of the ocean. The letter itself would have caused
very little excitement, but the "notes" were vigorous causes
of irritation and antagonism. The authorship of the
"notes" was a matter of dispute. It was claimed that they
were not written by Anna Braithwaite, and the internal
evidence gave color to that conclusion. They were not, in
whole or in part, entirely in her spirit, and the temper of
them was rather masculine. There were persons who
believed, but, of course, without positive evidence, that
Joseph John Gurney was their author.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_151_151" id="Footnote_151_151"></a><a href="#FNanchor_151_151"><span class="label">[151]</span></a> The text of this letter will be found listed as <a href="#APPENDIX_B">Appendix B</a> in
this book.</p></div>

<p>The letter of Anna Braithwaite contains few points not
covered by the "notes." She charges that Elias had denied
that the Scriptures were a rule of faith and practice, and
it was also claimed that he repudiated "the propitiatory sacrifice
of our Lord and <span class="correction" title="Originally: Savious">Saviour</span> Jesus Christ." This, she
affirmed, was infidelity of a most pronounced type.</p>

<p>The "notes" attached to this letter constitute a stinging
arraignment of the supposed sentiments of Elias Hicks.
They were considered by his friends such an unwarranted
attack as to call for vigorous treatment, and in numerous
ways they became points of controversy. They were mild
at first, but personal and almost bitter at the last. The first
"note" in the collection briefly, but fully, lays the foundation
for arbitrary authority in religion. It says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is a regulation indispensably necessary to the peace
of society, and to the preservation of order, consistency
and harmony among Christians, that the members of every
religious body, and especially those who assume the office
of teachers or ministers, should be responsible to the
authorities established in the church, for the doctrines
which they hold and promulgate."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_152_152" id="Footnote_152_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_152_152"><span class="label">[152]</span></a> A letter from Anna Braithwaite to Elias Hicks, on the Nature
of His Doctrines, etc., p. 9.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span></p></div>

<p>There is critical reference to a statement which Anna
Braithwaite said Elias Hicks made in the Meeting of Ministers
and Elders in Jericho, touching spiritual guidance in
appointing people to service in the Society. She says that
Elias declared that "if each Friend attended to his or her
proper gift, as this spirit is endued with prescience, that no
Friend would be named for any appointment, but such as
would attend, and during my long course of experience, I
have never appointed any one who was prevented from
attending either by illness or otherwise."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_153_153" id="Footnote_153_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_153_153"><span class="label">[153]</span></a> The same, p. 4.</p></div>

<p>In his letter to Dr. Atlee, Elias states his expression at
the meeting as differing from Anna Braithwaite's in a
material way. This is what he declares he said: "That I
thought there was something wrong in the present instance,
for, as we profess to believe in the guidance of the Spirit of
Truth as an unerring Spirit, was it not reasonable to expect,
especially in a meeting of ministers and elders, that if each
Friend attended to their proper gifts, as this Spirit is endued
with prescience, that it would be much more likely, under
its divine influence, we should be led to appoint such as
would attend on particular and necessary occasions, than to
appoint those who would not attend?"</p>

<p>We make these quotations not only to show the difference
in the two statements, but to also make it plain what
small faggots were used to build the fires of controversy
regarding the opinions of Elias Hicks. It looks in this
particular citation like a case of criticism gone mad. The
following extracts are from the "notes":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We shall now notice the comparatively modern work
of that arch-infidel, Thomas Paine, called "The Age of
Reason," many of the sentiments of which are so exactly
similar to those of Elias Hicks, as almost to induce us to
suspect plagiarism."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_154_154" id="Footnote_154_154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_154_154"><span class="label">[154]</span></a> The same, p. 23-24.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span></p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"We could adduce large quotations from authors of the
same school with Paine, showing in the most conclusive
manner that the dogmas of Elias Hicks, so far from being
further revelations of Christian doctrines, are merely the
stale objections to the religion of the Bible, which have been
so frequently routed and driven from the field, to the utter
shame and confusion of their promulgators."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Those who defended Elias Hicks saw in these criticisms
an act of persecution, and a veiled attempt to undermine
his reputation as a man and a minister. The latter
effort was read into the following paragraph, which was
presented as an effort at justifying the criticism of the
Jericho preacher. We quote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was both Friendly and Christian to warn them of
the danger of listening with credulity to one whose high
profession, reputed morality, and popular eloquence, had
given him considerable influence; and if his opinions had
been correct, the promulgation of them would not have
proved prejudicial to him."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The references to Thomas Paine will sound singularly
overdrawn if read in connection with the reference of Elias
Hicks to the same person.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> It may be asserted with some
degree of safety that it is doubtful if either Elias Hicks or
his critics ever read enough of the writings of Thomas
Paine to be really qualified to judicially criticise them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>When Anna Braithwaite visited this country the second
time, in 1825, she found matters much more unsettled than
on her first visit. Her own part in the controversy had
been fully, if not fairly, discussed. As showing her own
feeling touching the second visit, we quote the following
from a sermon preached by her:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span></p><blockquote>

<p>"I have thought many times, while surrounded by my
family and my friends, and when I have bowed before the
throne of grace, how very near and how very dear were
my fellow-believers, on this side of the Atlantic, made unto
my soul. It seemed to me, as if in a very remarkable manner,
their everlasting welfare was brought before me, as if
my fellow-professors of the same religious principles with
myself were in a very peculiar manner the objects of much
solicitude. How have I had to pour out my soul in secret
unto the Lord, that he would turn them more and more,
and so let their light shine before men, that all being
believers in a crucified Saviour, they may be brought to
know for themselves that though 'Christ Crucified was to
the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness;
but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks,
Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.' I say
my soul hath been poured out before the Lord, that their
light might shine in a still more conspicuous manner,
through their hearts being brought into deep prostration of
soul, that so their works might glorify their Father which is
in heaven. My heart was enlarged toward every religious
denomination; for surely, the world over, those who are
believers in Christ have one common bond of union&mdash;they
are the salt of the earth&mdash;the little flock to whom the Father
in his good pleasure will give the Kingdom. I have often
greatly desired to be with you, while I am well aware that
to many it must appear a strange thing, that a female
should leave her home, her family, and her friends, and
should thus expose herself to the public, to preach the glad
tidings of salvation through Jesus Christ; yet I have
thought, my beloved friends, that though all may not see
into these things, yet surely there is no other way for any
of us, but to yield up our thoughts unto the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p></blockquote>

Meeting, Arch Street, Philadelphia, October 26, 1825. Taken in short-hand
by M. T. C. Gould, stenographer, p. 4-5.</p></div>

<p>There seem to have been some Friends desirous of
producing a meeting between Anna Braithwaite and Elias
Hicks during this visit. In Tenth month, 1825, she wrote
him from Kipp's Bay, Long Island. She informed him of
her arrival, and then stated "that if he wishes to have any
communication with her, she is willing to meet him in the
presence of their mutual friends, or to answer any letter he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span>
may write to her;" then she adds these remarkable words:
"Having written to thee sometime ago, what I thought was
right, I do not ask an interview."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>To this communication Elias Hicks made a somewhat
full reply. He says that her notes of the conversation,
"divers of which were without foundation," led him to
wonder why she should even think of having any future
communication with him. He then says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That I have no desire for any further communication
with thee, either directly or indirectly, until thou makest
a suitable acknowledgment for thy breach of friendship, as
is required by the salutary discipline of our Society; but as
it respects myself, I freely forgive thee, and leave thee to
pursue thy own way as long as thou canst find true peace
and quiet therein."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It has to be said regretfully that during Anna Braithwaite's
second visit to this country, she met with both
personal and Society rebuffs. In some meetings her minute
was read, but with no expression of approbation in the case.
The Meeting of Ministers and Elders at Jericho appointed
a committee,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> to advise her not to appoint any more meetings
in that neighborhood during her stay. A good many
Friends objected to her family visits, and, taken altogether,
her stay must have been one of trial.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_161_161" id="Footnote_161_161"></a><a href="#FNanchor_161_161"><span class="label">[161]</span></a> The same, p. 59.</p></div>

<p>She came again in the early part of the year 1827,
and was here when the climax came in that year and the
year following.</p>

<p>The English Friends, who were so much in evidence
in our troubles, went home to face the Beacon controversy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span><a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
then gathering in England. The Beaconite movement
caused several hundred Friends to sever their connection
with the Society. But it did not reach the dignity of a
division or a separation. Whether the English Friends
profited by the experiences suffered by the Society in
America is not certain. At any rate, they seem to have
been able to endure their differences without a rupture.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_162_162" id="Footnote_162_162"></a><a href="#FNanchor_162_162"><span class="label">[162]</span></a> This controversy took its name from a periodical called the "Beacon,"
edited by Isaac Crewdson. In this evangelical doctrines and
methods were advocated. The Beaconites were strong in advocating
the doctrine of justification by faith, and practically rejected the
fundamental Quaker theory of the Inner Light. From the American
standpoint, the Beaconite position seems to have been the logical
development of the doctrines preached by the English and American
opponents of Elias Hicks.</p></div>

<p>After the English trouble had practically subsided, in
1841, Anna Braithwaite made the following suggestive admission,
which may well close this chapter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Calm reflection and observation of passing events, and
of persons, have convinced me that I took an exaggerated
view of the state of society with reference to Hicksism....
We have as great a horror of Hicksism as ever, but
we think Friends generally are becoming more alive to its
dangers, and that the trials of the last few years have been

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Ann Jones in Dutchess County.</p>


<p>In Fifth month, 1828, a year after the division had
been accomplished in Philadelphia, a most remarkable round
of experiences took place within the bounds of Nine Partners
and Stanford Quarterly Meetings, in Dutchess County,
New York. Elias Hicks was past eighty years of age, but
he attended the series of meetings in the neighborhood mentioned.
George and Ann Jones, English Friends, much in
evidence in "separation" matters, were also in attendance,
the result being a series of controversial exhortations,
mingled with personal allusions, sometimes gently veiled,
but containing what would now pass for bitterness and
railing. The "sermons" of this series were stenographically
reported, and form a small book of ninety-eight pages.</p>

<p>The first meeting was held at Nine Partners, First-day,
Fifth month 4th. Elias Hicks had the first service in the
meeting. After he had closed, Ann Jones made the following
remarks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have heard considerable said, and we have heard,
under a specious pretence of preaching, the Gospel, the
Saviour of the world denied, who is God and equal with
the Father. And we have heard that the Scriptures had
done more hurt than good. We have also heard the existence
of a devil denied, except what arises from our propensities,
desires, &amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p></blockquote>

of Friends, at the Quarterly Meeting of Nine Partners and Stanford,
and first day preceding in Fifth month, 1828. Taken in <span class="correction" title="Originally: shorthand">short-hand</span> by
Henry Hoag, p. 20.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span></p></div>

<p>After this deliverance, Elias Hicks again arose and said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I will just observe that my friends are acquainted
with me in these parts, and know me very well when I
speak to them. I came not here as a judge, but as a counsellor:
I leave it for the people to judge. And I would
hope to turn them to nothing but a firm and solid conviction
in their minds. We may speak one by one, for that
becometh order. I thought I would add a word or two
more. When I was young, I read the Scriptures, and I
thought that they were not the power, nor the spirit, and
that there was but very little in them for me; but I was
vain. But when I had once seen the sin in my heart, then
I found that this book pointed to the Spirit, but never convicted
me of sin.</p>

<p>"I believe that this was the doctrine of ancient Friends;
for George Fox declared that his Saviour never could be
slain by the hands of wicked men. I believe the Scriptures
concerning Jesus Christ, and David, too, and a host of
others, who learned righteousness and were united one with
another. I believe that Jesus Christ took upon him flesh
made under the law, for all people are made under the law,
and Christ is this Light which enlighteneth every man that
comes into the world. And now, my friends, I would not
have you believe one word of what I say, unless by solid
conviction."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_165_165" id="Footnote_165_165"></a><a href="#FNanchor_165_165"><span class="label">[165]</span></a> The same.</p></div>

<p>It will be in order to find out what was said by Elias
Hicks which called for the personal allusion made by Ann
Jones. We are not able to find in the remarks of Elias Hicks
on this occasion anything that would justify the strong language
of his critic, especially as to the Scriptures having
done more hurt than good. It would seem that the supplementary
statement quoted must be accepted as containing
his estimate of the book which he was charged with repudiating,
rather than the critical assertion of his doctrinal
opponent.</p>

<p>There are various statements in the Hicks sermon
which denied some of the material claims of popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
theology, but they did not class him with those who denied
the existence or spiritual office of Christ. In the meetings
under review, and at other times, the evidence is abundant
that his critics either did not want to or could not understand
him. He dealt with the spirit of the gospel, and with
the inner manifestation of that spirit in the heart. They
stood for scriptural literalness, and for the outward appearance
of Christ. It is not for us to condemn either side in
the controversy, but to state the case.</p>

<p>We produce a few sentences and expressions from the
sermon by Elias Hicks, which might have created antagonism
at the time. Speaking of the "Comforter" which was
to come, he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And what was this Comforter? Not an external one&mdash;not
Jesus Christ outward, to whom there was brought diseased
persons and he delivered them from their various
diseases.... Here, now, he told them how to do: he
previously made mention that when the Comforter had
come, he would reprove the world of sin&mdash;now the world
is every rational soul under heaven. And he has come and
reproved them. I dare appeal to the wickedest man
present, that will acknowledge the truth, that this Light
has come into the world; but men love darkness better than
light, because their deeds are evil; yet they know the light
by an evidence in their hearts."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Near the end of this discourse he elaborated his idea as
to the ineffectual character of all outward and formal soul
cleansing, in the following language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now can any man of common sense suppose that it
can be outward blood that was shed by the carnal Jews that
will cleanse us from our sins? The blood of <span class="correction" title="Originally: Chirst">Christ</span> that
is immortal, never can be seen by mortal eyes. And to be
Christians, we must come to see an immortal view. After
Christ had recapitulated the precepts of the law, 'Is it not
written in your law, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
tooth: but I say unto you, if a man smite thee on one cheek
turn to him the other also: and if a man take thy coat from
thee, give him thy cloak also.' Don't we see how different
the precepts of the law of God are? He tells us how we
should do&mdash;we should take no advantage at all. The
Almighty visits us, to get us willing to observe his law; and
if all were concerned to maintain his law, all lawyers would
be banished; we should have no need of them; as well
as of hireling Priests. We should have no need of them
to teach us, nor no need of the laws of men, for each one
would have a law in his own mind."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The other points in Dutchess County visited, and
involved in the reports of sermons under consideration, were
Chestnut Ridge, Stanford and Oblong. At some of these
meetings the preachers spoke more than once. It does not
appear that in the brief communications of George Jones
he either directly or indirectly referred to statements made
by Elias Hicks, or particularly sought to antagonize them.
Ann Jones, however, was not similarly considerate and
cautious. Either directly or by inference, she quite generally
attempted to furnish the antidote for what she considered
the pernicious doctrine of her fellow-minister.
Speaking at Nine Partners Quarterly Meeting, Fifth month
7th, she said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I believe it to be right for me to caution the present
company without respect of persons&mdash;how they deny the
Lord that bought them&mdash;how they set at nought the outward
coming of the Lord Jesus Christ who died for them:
they will have to answer it at the awful tribunal bar of God,
where it will be altogether unavailing to say that such a
one taught me to believe that there was nothing in this.
Oh! my friends! God hath not left us without a witness;
Oh, then it is unto the faithful and true witness, 'the testimony
of Jesus, which is the spirit of prophecy.' I am engaged
in gospel love to recommend, and to hold out unto
you, that you meddle not with the things of God; and that
you cry unto him for help. For what hope can they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span>
of present or future good, or of everlasting happiness, if
they reject the only means appointed of God to come unto
the Father through Jesus Christ, the messenger of God, and
of the new covenant?"<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p>At this meeting Elias Hicks followed Ann Jones in
vocal communication. He made no direct reference to
what she said, the short sermon being largely a reiteration
touching the inner revelation to the souls of men, as the
reprover of sin, and the power which kept from sinning,
as against the outward, sacrificial form of salvation. In
closing his remarks, Elias Hicks made this statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not wish to detain this assembly much longer,
but I want that we should cast away things that are mysterious,
for we cannot comprehend mystery. 'Secret things
belong to God, but those that are revealed (that are understood),
to us and our children.' And those that are secret
can never be found out by the prying of mortals. Do we
suppose for a moment&mdash;for it would cast an indignity upon
God to suppose that he had laid down any name except his
own by which we can have communion with him. It is a
plain way, a simple way which all can understand, and not
be under the necessity to go to a neighbor, and to say,
'Know thou the Lord? for all shall know me, from the least
of them unto the greatest of them,' as said Jeremy the
prophet. It is bowing down to an ignorant state of mind, to
suppose that there is no other power whereby we can come
unto God, but by one of the offspring of Abraham, and that
we have need to go back to the law which was given to the
Israelites, and to no other people. He has never made any
covenant with any other people, but that which he made
with our first parents. That is the covenant that has been
made with all the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>"He justifies for good and condemns for evil. And
although every action is to be from the operation of his
power, yet he has given us the privilege to obey or disobey;
here now is a self-evident truth; as they have the liberty
to choose, so if they do that which is contrary to his will,
and so slay the Divine life in the soul: and thus they have
slain the innocent Lamb of God in the soul, which is the
same thing. All that we want, is to return to the inward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>
light in the soul. The Lord had declared beforehand unto
them in plain characters, that none need to say, 'Know ye
the Lord? for I will be merciful to them, I will forgive their
iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.' This
was equally the case until the law was abolished: until he
blotted out the handwriting of the law, and put an end to
outward ordinances. The law was fulfilled when they had
crucified him, then it was that that law was abolished that
consisted in making their atonements which all had to make.</p>

<p>"The people could not understand the doctrine delivered
in the sermon on the mount, although plainly
preached to them. Jesus, when about to take leave of his
disciples, left this charge with them: 'Tarry at Jerusalem
until the Holy Ghost come upon you'; and then, and not
till then, were they to bear witness unto him. He told
them that it would bring everything to their remembrance:
everything which is by the preaching of the gospel brought
to your remembrance; therefore he says: 'All things shall
be brought to your remembrance.' They would not then
be looking to anything outward, because he had filled them
with the Spirit of truth. What is this, but this Comforter
which reproves the world of sin? All that will obey the
voice of this reprover in the soul are in the way of redemption
and salvation. 'By disobedience, sin entered into the
world and death by sin: but life and immortality is brought
to light by the gospel.' I am willing to leave you, and I
recommend you to God, and the power of his grace, which is
able to build you up, as you are faithful to its operation."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The last meeting of the series was held in connection
with Nine Partners Quarterly Meeting, Fifth month 9th.
This was evidently the closing session of the Quarterly
Meeting. From these published sermons it would seem
that Elias Hicks and George Jones were the only Friends
who engaged in vocal ministry that day. There was nothing
specially relevant to the controversy going on in the Society
in either of these short discourses.</p>

<p>In reading this collection of sermons one cannot avoid
the conclusion that, apart from dissimilarity in phraseology,
and the matters involved in interpreting Scripture, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
Friends had much in common. Had they been minded to
seek for the common ground, it is quite probable that they
would have found that they were really quarreling over
the minor, rather than the major, propositions.</p>

<p>In Eighth month, 1828, Elias Hicks was on his last
religious visit to the Western Yearly Meetings. The "separation"
in the New York Yearly Meeting had taken place
in Fifth month, the trouble then passing to the Quarterly
and particular meetings. It reached Nine Partners at the
Quarterly Meeting held as above. Ann Jones attended this
meeting, the last sermon in the little volume from which
the extracts given in this chapter are taken having been
preached by this Friend. There was little new matter in
this sermon. Much, by inuendo, was laid at the door of
those who were pronounced unorthodox, and who constituted
a majority of the meeting.</p>

<p>So far as the charge of persecution is concerned, it was
repeatedly employed by Elias Hicks and his sympathizers
in describing the spirit and conduct of the orthodox party.
In this particular, at least, the disputants on both sides were
very much alike. Ann Jones' reference to throwing down
"his elders and prophets" contains more touching the
animus of the controversy than the few words really indicate.
As will be somewhat clearly shown in these pages,
the trouble in the Society quite largely had reference to
authority in the church, and its arbitrary exercise by a select
few, constituting a sort of spiritual and social hierarchy in
the monthly meetings. It was this authoritative class which
had been "thrown down," or was likely to be so repudiated.</p>

<p>We would by no means claim that with the "separation"
an accomplished fact, the body of Friends not of the orthodox
party thus gathered by themselves became at once and
continuously relieved of the arbitrary spirit. The history
of this branch of the Society from 1827 to 1875, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>
places down to date, would entirely disprove any such claim.
It would seem that wherever the Society lost ground numerically,
and wherever its spiritual life dwindled, it was due
largely because some sort of arbitrary authority ignored
the necessity for real spiritual unity, and discounted the
spiritual democracy upon which the Society of Friends was
based.</p>

<p>The "separation" in the Quarterly Meetings in
Dutchess County was perfected in Eighth month, 1828.
Both Anna Braithwaite and Ann Jones were in attendance,
and evidently took part in the developments at that time.
Elias Hicks was on his last religious visit to the "far west."
Informing partnership letters were sent to Elias, then in
Mt. Pleasant, Ohio, by Jacob and Deborah Willetts,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> under
date of Eighth month 18, 1828. Jacob gave brief but explicit
information as to the division in the several meetings.
For instance, he says that in Oswego Monthly Meeting one-sixth
of the members went orthodox. At Creek, about one-fourth
left to form an orthodox meeting, about the same
proportion existing at Stanford. Nine Partners seems to
have been the center of the difficulty, the orthodox leadership
apparently having been more vigorous at that point.
Still, about three-fourths of the members refused to join
the orthodox. A very brief appreciation of the transatlantic
visitors is given in Jacob's letter. He says: "The
English Friends are very industrious, but I do not find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>
it amounts to much. Friends have generally become
acquainted with their man&oelig;uvring."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_170_170" id="Footnote_170_170"></a><a href="#FNanchor_170_170"><span class="label">[170]</span></a> Jacob and Deborah Willetts were friendly educators in the first
half of the nineteenth century. Jacob became principal of Nine
Partners boarding school in 1803, when only 18 years of age, and
Deborah Rogers principal of the girl's department in 1806, when at
the same age. Jacob Willetts and Deborah Rogers were married in
1812. At the time of the "separation," Nine Partners' school passed
into the hands of the Orthodox, and Jacob and Deborah resigned their
positions, and started a separate school, which they conducted successfully
for nearly thirty years. Jacob was the author of elementary
text books of arithmetic and geography, and Deborah was an accomplished
grammarian, and assisted Gould Brown in the preparation
of his once well-known English Grammar.</p></div>

<p>Deborah's letter was both newsy and personal, and
threw interesting sidelights on the "separation" experiences.
At the close of a sermon by Ann Jones, Eighth month 5th,
she made reference to the sudden death of a woman
Friend of the orthodox party, which is thus referred to in
this letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Perhaps thou wilt hear ere this reaches thee of the
death of Ann Willis. She died at William Warings on her
way home from Purchase Quarterly Meeting, in an apoplectic
fit. At our Quarterly Meeting Ann Jones told us
of the dear departed spirit of one who had lived an unspotted
life, who passed away without much bodily suffering,
and whose soul was now clothed in robes of white, singing
glory, might and majesty with angels forever and ever:
which amounted nearly to a funeral song."</p></blockquote>

<p>We make the following extract from the letter of Deborah
Willetts because of its interesting references and statements:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A week ago I returned from Stanford Quarterly Meeting
held at Hudson. All the English force was there save
T. Shillitoe with a large re-enforcement from New York,
but they were headed by 15 men and 25 women of the committee
of Friends, and a great many attended from the
neighboring meetings, Coeymans, Rensalaerville, Saratoga,
&amp;c. The city was nearly full. Anna Braithwaite and suite
took lodgings at the hotel. It was the most boisterous
meeting I ever attended. The clerks in each meeting were
orthodox, but Friends were favored to appoint others who
opened the meeting. Anna Braithwaite had much to say
to clear up the charges against her in circulation that their
expenses had been borne by Friends, which she said was
false, and never had been done but in two instances, and
mentioned it twice or three times that her dear husband
felt it a very great pleasure to meet all expenses she might
incur, and she would appeal to those present for the truth
of what she had said, and then Ann Jones, Claussa Griffin,
Ruth Hallock, Sarah Upton and some others immediately
attested to the truth of it. Oh, how inconsistent is all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span>
in a Friends' meeting. She also gave a long statement of
the separation at Yearly Meeting, but she was reminded of
her absence at the time, but she replied Ann Jones had
informed her. She accused Friends of holding erroneous
doctrine and said Phebe I. Merritt did not believe in the
atonement for sin. Phebe said she denied the charge, when
Anna turning and looking stern in her face said, 'Did thou
not say, Phebe Merritt, all the reproof thou felt for sin was
in thy own breast?' Phebe then arose and was favored to
express her views in a clear way with an affecting circumstance
that she experienced in her childhood that brought
such a solemnity over the meeting that almost disarmed
Anna of her hostile proceedings. She stood upon her feet
the while ready to reply but began in a different tone of
voice, and changed the subject, and very soon after, Ann
Jones made a move to adjourn when they could hold Stanford
Quarterly Meeting, which was seconded by several
others and Friends in the meantime as cordially and
silently uniting with them in the motion. They then
retired without reading an adjournment, I afterwards
learnt, to the Presbyterian Conference room. I dined in
company with Willett Hicks, who said he was surprised to
see so few go with them after such a noble effort."</p></blockquote>

<p class="subtitle">The Experience with T. Shillitoe.</p>


<p>The first day after his arrival in America, Thomas
Shillitoe<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> attended Hester Street Meeting, in New York.
He tells that "it was reported that he had come over to help
the Friends of Elias Hicks."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> As this Friend came into
collision with Elias several times, and was second to none
in vigor and virulence among his antagonists, either
domestic or foreign, it seems proper to review his connection
with the controversy, because some added light may
thus be thrown on the spirit and purpose of the opposition
to Elias Hicks.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_171_171" id="Footnote_171_171"></a><a href="#FNanchor_171_171"><span class="label">[171]</span></a> Thomas Shillitoe was born in London "about the Second month,
1754," Elias Hicks being six years his senior. His parents were not
Friends. At one time his father kept an inn. Joined Grace Church
Street Monthly Meeting in London about 1775. Was acknowledged
a minister at Tottenham in 1790. He learned the grocery business, and
afterward entered a banking house. Finally learned shoemaker's trade,
and had a shop. Was married in 1778. Came to America in 1826, arriving
in New York, Ninth month 8th. While here traveled extensively,
visiting certain Indian tribes. In 1827 he had an interview
with President Andrew Jackson. He left New York for Liverpool in
Eighth month, 1829, having been in this country nearly three years.
Thomas Shillitoe died in 1836.</p></div>

<p>Of the experience on that first meeting in America the
venerable preacher says: "I found it hard work to rise upon
my feet, but believing that the offer of the best of all help
was made, I ventured and was favored to clear my mind
faithfully, and in a manner I apprehended would give such
of the followers of Elias Hicks as were present a pretty
clear idea of the mistake they had been under of my being
come over to help their unchristian cause."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>He had not been seen at that time to converse with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>
single friend of Elias Hicks, and there is no evidence that
during the three years he was in America he mingled at
all with any Friends who were not of the so-called orthodox
party.</p>

<p>During the week following his arrival in this country,
Thomas Shillitoe visited Jericho by way of Westbury. Regarding
his visit he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We took our dinner with G. Seaman; after which we
proceeded to Jericho, and took up our abode this night with
our kind friend, Thomas Willis. In passing through the
village of Jericho, Elias Hicks was at his own door; he
invited me into his own house to take up my abode, which
I found I could not have done, even had we not previously
concluded to take up our abode with T. Willis. I refused
his offer in as handsome a manner as I well knew how.
He then pressed me to make him a call; I was careful to
make such a reply as would not make it binding upon me,
although we had to pass his door on our way to the next
meeting. I believe it was safest for me not to comply with
his request."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>G. Seaman, mentioned above, became the first clerk of
the Orthodox Monthly Meeting of Westbury and Jericho,
organized after the "separation," and Thomas Willis was
the Friend who should probably be called the father of
the opposition to Elias Hicks. Had the English visitor
determined from the start to hear nothing, and know nothing
but one side of the controversy, he could not have more
fully made that possible than by the intercourse he had with
Friends on this continent.</p>

<p>To show how bent he was not to be influenced or contaminated
by those not considered orthodox, it may be
noted that while in Jericho he was visited by Friends in that
neighborhood, who urged him to call on them. He was at
first inclined to acquiesce, but after "waiting where the
divine counsellor is to be met with," he changed his mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>
remarking, "I afterwards understood some of these individuals
were of Elias Hicks's party."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>The New York Yearly Meeting of 1827 was attended
by all of the ministering Friends and their companions
from England, viz: Thomas Shillitoe, Elizabeth Robson,
George and Ann Jones, Isaac and Anna Braithwaite. There
seems to have been a foreshadowing of trouble in this
yearly meeting. Elizabeth Robson asked for a minute to
visit men's meeting, which met with some opposition, and
was characterized by confusion in carrying out the purpose.
Elias Hicks says nothing about the matter in his Journal,
and no reference was made to this Friend in his personal
correspondence. The English Friends left New York
before the close of the Yearly Meeting, to attend New
England Yearly Meeting.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to follow the wanderings of
Thomas Shillitoe in America. He was at the New York
Yearly Meeting again in 1828, at the time of the "separation."
Touching this occasion, the minutes of the meeting
in question furnish some information, as follows: "Thomas
Shillitoe, who is in this country on a religious visit from
England, objected to the company of some individuals who
were present with us, and members of a neighboring yearly
meeting, stating that they had been regularly disowned,"
etc.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> For thus dictating to the yearly meeting, Thomas
Shillitoe presented this justification:</p>

1828.</p></div>

and quarterly meeting, and also one from the Select Yearly

Yearly Meeting of New York, and entered in the records
of that Yearly Meeting; such being the case, it constitutes
me as much a member of this Yearly Meeting as any other
member of it."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This may have been according to good society order
and etiquette eighty odd years ago, but would hardly pass
current in our time. For a visitor in a meeting to object
to the presence of other visitors, on the ground of rumor
and with no regular or official evidence of the charges
against them, would probably put the objector into disfavor.
But we are not warranted in passing harsh judgment in
the nineteenth-century case. The English Friends, right or
wrong, came to this country under the impression that they
were divinely sent to save the Society of Friends in America
from going to the bad. At the worst, it was a case of
assuming the care of too many consciences.</p>

<p>Soon after the close of the New York Yearly Meeting
of 1828, both Thomas Shillitoe and Elias Hicks started on
a western trip. Elias seems to have preceded the English
Friend by a few days. The two men met at Westland.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
At this place Thomas says that Elias denied that Jesus was
the son of God, until after the baptism, and opposed the
proper observance of the Sabbath.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Of course, the statements
of Elias were controverted by his fellow-preacher,
or, at least, an attempt to do so was made. It should be
understood that Elias denied that Jesus was the son of God
in the sense in which Thomas conceived he was, and he
undoubtedly antagonized the observance of the Sabbath in
the slavish way which considered that man was secondary
to the institution.</p>

<p>Part of the mission of our English Friend from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
time seems to have been to oppose Elias Hicks, and turn
the minds of the people against him. They both attended
Redstone Monthly Meeting. Here Elias presented his
minute of unity and the other evidences of good faith which
he possessed. At this point Thomas says: "Observing a
disposition in most of the members of the meeting to have
these minutes read in the meeting, I proposed to the meeting
to consider how far with propriety they could read
them; after their Meeting for Sufferings had given forth
a testimony against the doctrines of Elias Hicks. But a
determination to read his minutes being manifested, Friends
were obliged to submit."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Taken altogether, this is a remarkable statement. The
"testimony" referred to was the "declaration of faith"<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
published by the Philadelphia Meeting for Sufferings.
This document did not mention Elias Hicks, and failed to
secure the approval of the Yearly Meeting, before the
"separation." It is evident that "most of the members"
were with Elias Hicks on this occasion. Only the few
opposers were "Friends"; so the statement infers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The two preachers are next heard from at Redstone
Quarterly Meeting, where Thomas was disposed to practice
an act of self-denial. He told the meeting that he preferred
his own minute should not be read, if Elias Hicks's was
received. We have some evidence from Elias Hicks himself
regarding this incident, in a letter written to Valentine
and Abigail Hicks, from Pittsburg, Eighth month 5, 1828,
stating the proposition of Thomas Shillitoe regarding his
minute. Elias says: "Friends took him at his word, and
let him know that they should not minute it, but insisted
that mine should be minuted, expressing very general satisfaction
with my company and service, and reprobated his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
in plain terms, and charged him and his companion with
breach of the order and discipline of the Society, and
insisted that the elders and overseers should stop at the
close of the meeting and see what could be done to put a
stop to such disorderly conduct."</p>

<p>Thomas then says that he exposed Elias Hicks as
an impostor "in attempting as he did to impose himself upon
the public as a minister in unity with the Society of
Friends; the Society having, by a printed document, declared
against his doctrine, and himself as an approved
minister."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Evidently this was another reference to the
much-lauded "declaration of faith," although this did not
represent an actually authoritative declaration of the Society.
At its best, Philadelphia's Meeting for Sufferings
was not the Society of Friends; but the people still wanted
to hear Elias. They apparently preferred to interpret him
at first-hand.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Thomas Shillitoe tells us that when they crossed the
Ohio River he talked with the woman at the ferry, who
protested against the ideas of Elias Hicks, and then remarks:
"She kept a tavern, and I left with her one of the declarations,
requesting her to circulate it amongst her neighbors."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
Evidently the publican, in this case, was sound in
the faith as held by the English preacher.</p>

<p>Mt. Pleasant was next visited by both Friends, preceding
and at Ohio Yearly Meeting. They do not seem to
have come personally into collision at this point, and insofar
as either makes reference to the occurrences there, they are
in substantial agreement.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Thomas Shillitoe bears mildly
veiled testimony to the desire of the people to hear Elias
Hicks, in the following statement: "From the great con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span>course
of people we passed in the afternoon on the way
to Short Creek Meeting, where Elias Hicks was to be, I
had cherished a hope we should have had a quiet meeting
at Mt. Pleasant."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> But the contrary was the case; to
whom the blame was due, the reader may decide.</p>

<p>It is to be presumed that these two Friends, both of
whom performed valuable service for the Society, according
to their lights and gifts, never met after their western
experience. For the want of understanding each other,
they went their way not as fellow-servants, but as strangers,
if not enemies. The unity of the spirit was obliterated in
a demand for uniformity of speculative doctrine.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Disownment and Doctrine.</p>


<p>The "separation" was accomplished in most meetings
in the East by the withdrawal of the orthodox party, after
which they set up new meetings for worship and discipline.
In a minority of meetings the orthodox held the property
and the organization, and the other Friends withdrew. At
Jericho and Westbury the great majority of the members
remained, and continued to occupy the old meeting-houses.
The orthodox who separated from the Westbury and
Jericho Monthly Meetings organized the Monthly Meeting
of Westbury and Jericho, as has already been mentioned.</p>

<p>In 1829, when the new monthly meeting was formed,
the membership of Westbury Monthly Meeting was as
follows: Westbury Preparative Meeting, 193; Matinecock
Preparative Meeting, 121; Cow Neck (now Manhassett),
65; total, 379. Of this number, accessions to the orthodox
were: From Westbury Preparative Meeting, 32; Matinecock
Preparative Meeting, 2; Cow Neck Preparative Meeting,
5; total, 39. In Jericho the members of the monthly
meeting, Fifth month, 1829, numbered 225. Of this number,
nine left to join the Monthly Meeting of Westbury
and Jericho, and five were undetermined in their choice.
Giving the latter meeting the benefit of the doubt, and
assigning to it the five uncertain members, the meeting that
disowned Elias Hicks was composed of fifty-three members,
of whom thirteen were minors and five of only mild
allegiance.</p>

<p>A simple mathematical calculation will show that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>
Monthly Meeting of Westbury and Jericho contained 10 per
cent. of the Friends who had been members of the two
original monthly meetings, which meetings still survived,
retaining 90 per cent. of the members. These figures will
throw suggestive light on what follows.</p>

<p>It was the Westbury and Jericho Monthly Meeting
which, on the 29th of Fourth month, 1829, adopted the
"testimony against Elias Hicks," called his disownment. It
contained specified charges, which may be condensed as
follows: He denied the influence or existence of an evil
spirit; doubted the fall of man, and his redemption through
Christ; endeavored to "destroy a belief in the miraculous
conception of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ"; also
rejected a "belief in his holy offices, his propitiatory offering
for the redemption of mankind; and has denied his
resurrection and ascension into heaven"; "he also denied
his mediation and intercession with the Father." He was
charged with too much industry in promulgating his views,
causing great numbers to embrace them, "and has at length
become the leader of a sect distinguished by his name."
He was also charged with meeting with, and countenancing
by his presence and conduct, those who had "separated"
from Friends. This had reference to many meetings of a
large majority of the Society held at various places in 1828.
The "testimony" also alleges that he had many times been
tenderly admonished and advised, but that he and his friends
"prevented the timely exercise of the discipline in his case."
It all, without doubt, sounded very formidable to the little
company of Friends who formulated and issued the
document.</p>

<p>This was a remarkable document in more ways than
one. The meeting which issued it assumed an authority in
conduct hard now to understand, and asserted as facts mere
assumptions, and yet we are bound to believe that, in the
main, they thought they were performing God's service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span>
It must be remembered that the orthodox Friends, in 1829,
everywhere operated on the theory that those who considered
themselves "sound in doctrine," no matter how few
in numbers, were the Society of Friends, in direct descent
from the founders of the faith. It was their religious duty
to excommunicate all whom they considered unsound, even
though those disowned might constitute the overwhelming
portion of the meeting. That this was the sincere conviction
of the orthodox Friends all through the "separation"
period, and also before and after it, is a demonstrable fact
of history. There was also a marked disposition to adhere
to tradition and to cling to former precedents. If there
had ever been a time when Friends had been disowned on
account of theological opinions, the practice should be kept
up, and practically continued forever.</p>

<p>That there was a considerable amount of precedent
for disowning Friends on points of doctrine is undoubtedly
true. In the famous New Jersey Chancery trial, Samuel
Parsons gave several cases of such disownment.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> They
involved cases in half a dozen monthly meetings, and
included charges as follows: Denying the miraculous conception;
denying the divinity of Jesus Christ; denying the
authenticity of the Scriptures; promulgating the belief that
the souls of the wicked would be annihilated.</p>

<p>The orthodox Friends might have done still better, and
cited the case of John Bartram,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> the father of American
botany, who was disowned by Darby Monthly Meeting in
1758, for deistical and other unorthodox opinions. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>
been supposed that Bartram was disowned by Friends for
placing the following inscription over his door:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_187_187" id="Footnote_187_187"></a><a href="#FNanchor_187_187"><span class="label">[187]</span></a> John Bartram, born near Darby, Pa., Third month 23, 1699.
Was the earliest native American botanist. He died Ninth month
22, 1777. Bartram traveled extensively in the American colonies in
pursuit of his botanical studies and investigations. He established
the Bartram Botanical Gardens near the Schuykill River, which are
still often visited.</p></div>

<div class="verse">The Holy One by me adored.</div>
<div class="verse indent4">John Bartram, 1770."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As this sentiment is dated twelve years after the disownment,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
it is evident that it was not the primary cause
of the action taken by Darby Monthly Meeting.</p>

<div class="footnote">

William Darlington, 1849, p. 42.</p></div>

<p>During the period of repression in the Society, lasting
from about 1700 to 1850, it was not hard to find precedent
for disowning members on almost any ground, so that
the treatment of Elias Hicks, on account of alleged
"unsound" doctrine calls for no complaint on the score of
regularity. Disowning members for that cause in one
branch of Friends to-day would be practically inconceivable.
Its wisdom at any time was doubtful, and, in spite of
precedents, the practice was not general.</p>

<p>The main point in this transaction, however, is that
the meeting which issued the "testimony" against Elias
Hicks had no jurisdiction in the case. As a matter of fact,
he was never a member of the meeting in question, unless it
be assumed that 10 per cent. of two monthly meetings can
flock by themselves, organize a new meeting, and take over
the 90 per cent. without their knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>In the main, we do not care to consider or discuss the
points in the "testimony" under consideration. Those who
have followed the pages of this book thus far will be able
to decide whether the main causes as stated by those who
prepared and approved the document were true in fact, and
whether they would have constituted a sufficient reason for
the action of the Monthly Meeting of Westbury and Jericho,
had it possessed any authority in the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>Just what Elias Hicks thought regarding the matter of
Society and disciplinary authority in his case, we have documentary
evidence. In a private letter he said: "For how
can they disown those who never attended their meetings,
nor never had seen the inside of their new-built meeting-houses,
and who never acknowledged their little separate
societies? Would it not be as rational and consistent with
right order for a Presbyterian or a Methodist society to
treat with and disown us for not attending their meetings,
and not acknowledging their creed?"<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_189_189" id="Footnote_189_189"></a><a href="#FNanchor_189_189"><span class="label">[189]</span></a> Letter to Johnson Legg, Twelfth month 15, 1829.</p></div>

<p>There is one point in the "testimony" which cannot so
easily or reasonably be ignored. It says that Elias Hicks
"has at length become the leader of a sect, distinguished by
his name, yet unjustly assuming the character of Friends."
From the assumed standpoint of those who made this statement
of fact, it had no warrant. That body of Friends in,
at least, the Yearly Meetings of New York, Philadelphia,
and Baltimore, which at the time of the "separation" housed
two-thirds of all the members, was as much entitled to be
called Friends, and assume their "character," as the minority.
The distinguishing epithet was not of their selecting
or adoption, and those who applied it could scarcely with
propriety force it upon those who did not claim it or want it.
As for leadership, the outcome in 1827-28 was accomplished
without either the presence or assistance of Elias Hicks in
a majority of cases. If those who left the parent meetings
and set up meetings of their own were the "separatists,"
then, in a majority of cases, the name belonged to the party
that opposed Elias Hicks, and not to that body of Friends
who objected to the Society being divided or perpetuated
because of the personality or the preaching of any one man.</p>

<p>It has to be said that the disowning at the time of the
"separation" was not all on one side. Jericho Monthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[Pg 193]</span>
Meeting "testified against" at least four of the orthodox
party. But in every such case, so far as we are aware, no
charges regarding doctrine were made against any. The
disownments took place because the persons involved had become
connected with other meetings, and did not attend the
gatherings of that branch of Friends who issued disownments.
Both sides undoubtedly did many things at the
time which later would have been impossible.</p>

<p>Elias Hicks evidently approved the general order of
the Society in his time touching disownments. In a letter
directed to "My Unknown Friend," but having no date, he
deals with the disownment question. He goes on to say
that it had been the practice of the Society to disown members
for more than a century, when such members had
deviated "from the established order of Society," and he
reaches the conclusion that not to follow this course would
lead to "confusion and anarchy." He then says: "These
things considered, it appears to me the most rational and
prudent, when a particular member of any society dissents
in some particular tenet from the rest of that society, if
such dissent break communion and render it necessary in
the judgment of such society that a separation take place
between them, that it be done in the same way, and agreeable
to the general practice of such society in like cases."</p>

<p>It is quite certain, however, that Elias Hicks did not
think that disputed points of doctrine offered a sufficient
ground for disownment in the Society of Friends. In a
letter to David Evans, written at Jericho, Twelfth month
25, 1829, he says: "I apprehend that if the Friends who
took part in the controversy on the side of the miraculous
conception, and those on the opposition, will fully examine
both sides of the question, they will find themselves more or
less in error, as neither can produce sufficient evidence to
enforce a rational conviction on others.... Surely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span>
then, we who believe in the miraculous conception ought
not to censure our brethren in profession for having a different
opinion from ours, and especially as we have no
knowledge of the subject in any wise, but from history and
tradition. Surely, then, both parties are very far off the
true Christian foundation for keeping up the controversy,
inasmuch as it never has had the least tendency to gather
on the one hand or the other, but always to scatter and
divide, and still has the same baneful tendency."</p>

<p>The reader will not fail to consider that at this late
period Elias Hicks reiterates his personal belief in the
miraculous conception, although the "testimony" of disownment
against him charged that he was "endeavoring to
destroy a belief in that doctrine." Whatever may have
been his belief regarding the matter, it is clear that he did
not consider acceptance or rejection of the doctrine a determining
quality in maintaining a really Christian fellowship.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">After the "Separation."</p>


<p>A letter dated Solebury, Pa., Sixth month 21, 1828,
told of some experiences on his last western trip. It was
addressed to his son-in-law, Valentine Hicks. On the journey
from Jericho to New York, Elias was very much
annoyed, if not vexed, by the crowds of "vain and foolish
people coming from the city and its suburbs to see horses
trot." "How ridiculous and insignificant," he says, "is such
foolish conduct for professed rational beings! I can
scarcely conceive in thought an epithet degrading enough to
give a just estimate of such irrational conduct."</p>

<p>The "separation" had just been accomplished in the New
York Yearly Meeting, and as this was the first visit he had
made to the local meetings and Friendly neighborhoods
since that event, it is a matter of interest to learn from his
own hand how he was received by Friends in the meetings.
Rose and Hester Street Meetings, in New York, were
attended the First-day after leaving home. Elias says, in
the letter mentioned: "They were both large, solemn meetings,
showing evidently the comfort and benefit Friends
have derived from the orthodox troubles, (they) having
separated themselves from us." This may have been the
superficial view of many who were prominent in sustaining
Elias Hicks. They failed to see, as did their opponents,
that the "separation" no matter which side went off, was a
violation of the real spirit of Quakerism. It was an unfortunate
acknowledgment that "unity of the spirit" was a
failure, if it required absolute uniformity of doctrine for
its maintenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>Passing over to New Jersey, he reports universal
kindly treatment. In this particular he remarks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Indeed we have found nothing in the least degree to
discourage or impede our progress, unless it be an excess
of kindness from our friends, who can hardly give us up
to pass on, without favoring them with a visit in their own
houses. And not only Friends, but many who are not
members manifest much friendly regard and respect. On
Fourth-day we attended Friends' Monthly Meeting for
Rahway and Plainfield held at Plainfield, Friends having
given their neighbors notice of our intention to be there,
it was largely attended by those of other professions, and
some of the orthodox Friends', contrary to the expectation
of Friends also attended. It was truly a very solemn and
instructive good meeting, in which truth reigned. I was
truly comforted in the meeting for discipline in viewing
Friends' order, and the unity and harmony that prevailed,
and the brotherly condescension that was manifested in
transacting their business."</p></blockquote>

<p>Elias Hicks evidently possessed what might be called
a grain of humor. In Eleventh month, 1828, when practically
all of the "separations" had been accomplished, he
wrote to his wife from Redstone, Pa. He had not been
getting letters from home as he desired, and especially was
that true regarding the much-valued missives from
Jemima. He, therefore, says, toward the end of this particular
epistle: "If I do not receive some direct account
from home at one or both of these places (Alexandria or
Baltimore), I shall be ready to conclude that my friends
have forgotten me or turned orthodox."</p>

<p>Evidently there had been a readjustment of society
conditions in this neighborhood. He says: "Divers friends,
whose names I have forgotten, and some who have never
seen thee, but love thee on my account, desired to be affectionately
remembered to thee. Indeed, love and harmony
so abound among Friends in these parts, and the more they
are persecuted, the more love abounds, insomuch that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>
observed to them in some places, that if they continued
faithful to the openings of truth on the mind, that they
would so exalt the standard of love and light, that the old
adage would be renewed, 'See how the Quakers love one
another.'"</p>

<p>Returning from the long western trip, considered in
Chapter VI, Elias was met in New York by his wife and
daughter Elizabeth, where Westbury Quarterly Meeting
was attended. Many near and dear Friends greeted the
aged minister, inwardly, if not outwardly, congratulating
him upon his safe return home, and the labors so faithfully
performed. In mentioning the event, Elias says: "It was
truly a season of mutual rejoicing, and my spirit was deeply
humbled under a thankful sense of the Lord's preserving
power and adorable mercy, in carrying me through and
over all opposition, both within and without. He caused
all to work together for good, and the promotion of his own
glorious cause of truth and righteousness in the earth, and
landed me safe in the bosom of my dear family and friends
at home, and clothed my spirit with the reward of sweet
peace for all my labor and travail. Praises, everlasting
high praises be ascribed unto our God, for his mercy
endureth forever."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Dark days were approaching, and the heavy hand of a
great sorrow was about to be laid upon this strong man,
who had buffeted many storms, and who seemed now to be
feeling a period of calm and quiet. But we shall let Elias
Hicks tell the details in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Soon after my return from the aforesaid journey, I had
to experience a very severe trial and affliction in the removal
of my dearly beloved wife. She was taken down with a
cold, and although, for a number of days, we had no anticipation
of danger from her complaint, yet about five days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span>
after she was taken, the disorder appeared to settle on her
lungs, and it brought on an inflammation which terminated
in a dissolution of her precious life, on the ninth day from
the time she was taken ill. She had but little bodily pain,
yet as she became weaker, she suffered from shortness of
breathing; but before her close, she became perfectly tranquil
and easy, and passed away like a lamb, as though
entering into a sweet sleep, without sigh or groan, or the
least bodily pain, on the 17th of Third month, 1829: And
her precious spirit, I trust and believe, has landed safely on
the angelic shore, 'where the wicked cease from troubling,
and the weary are at rest.' To myself, to whom she was a
truly affectionate wife, and to our children, whom she endeavored,
by precept and example, to train up in the paths
of virtue, and to guard and keep out of harm's way, her
removal is a great and irreparable loss: and nothing is left
to us in that behalf, but a confident belief and an unshaken
hope, that our great loss is her still greater gain; and
although the loss and trial, as to all my external blessings,
are the greatest I have ever met with, or ever expect to
have to endure, yet I have a hope, that, though separated,
I may be preserved from mourning or complaining; and
that I may continually keep in view the unmerited favour
dispensed to us, by being preserved together fifty-eight
years in one unbroken bond of endeared affection, which
seemed if possible to increase with time to the last moment
of her life; and which neither time nor distance can lessen
or dissolve; but in the spiritual relation I trust it will
endure for ever, where all the Lord's redeemed children are
one in him, who is God over all, in all, and through all,
blessed forever. She was buried on the 19th, and on this
solemn occasion, the Lord, who is strength in weakness,
enabled me to bear a public and, I trust, a profitable testimony
to the virtues and excellences of her long and consistent
life."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Regarding the funeral of Jemima Hicks, and its aftermath,
rumor has been more or less busy. That Elias spoke
on this occasion is certain. It was his eighty-first birthday.
His remarks were undoubtedly in harmony, both as to the
matter and the hope of a future reunion, with the extract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span>
printed above. There is in existence what purports to be
matter copied from a Poughkeepsie newspaper relating to
this event. The statement is supplemented by a "poem,"
entitled "Orthodox Reflections on the Remarks Made by
Elias Hicks at His Wife's Funeral." These verses are
both theological and savage. Elias is assured that, because
of his belief, he cannot hope to "rest in heaven," or meet
his wife there. What is strange, however, is that verses,
signed "Elias Hicks," and in reply to the poetical attack,
are also given. The first-mentioned rhyme may be genuine,
as it voices an opinionated brutality and boldness which was
not uncommon in dealing with the future life eighty years
ago. But we can hardly imagine Elias Hicks being a
"rhymster" under any sort of provocation. If the two
"poems" were ever printed, touching the matter in question,
some one besides Elias, undoubtedly is responsible for the
rejoinder.</p>

<p>Near the 1st of Sixth month, and a little more than
three months after the death of his wife, Elias Hicks started
on his last religious visit. His concern took him to the
meetings and neighborhoods within the limits of his own
Yearly Meeting. Nothing unusual is reported on this visit
until Dutchess County was reached. All of the meetings
were reported satisfactory. Of the meetings at West
Branch, Creek and Crum-Elbow, Elias says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Although it was in the midst of harvest, such was
the excitement produced amongst the people by the opposition
made by those of our members who had gone off
from us, and set up separate meetings, that the people at
large of other societies flocked to those meetings in such
numbers, that our meeting-houses were seldom large
enough to contain the assembled multitude; and we had
abundant cause for thanksgiving and gratitude to the
blessed Author of all our mercies, in condescending to manifest
his holy presence, and causing it so to preside as to
produce a general solemnity, tendering and contriting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[Pg 200]</span>
many minds, and comforting and rejoicing the upright in
heart."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Proceeding up the Hudson, arriving at Albany on
Seventh-day, Eighth month 1st, that evening a large meeting
was held in the statehouse. Those present represented
the inhabitants generally of the capital city. Many meetings
were attended after leaving Albany, which have now
ceased to exist. In fact, few, if any, meetings then in
existence were missed on this journey. The 17th of Eighth
month he was in Utica. Of the meeting in that city, and
at Bridgewater, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"These were not so large as in some other places,
neither was there as much openness to receive our testimony
as had generally been the case elsewhere. Our
opposing Friends had filled their heads with so many
strange reports, to which they had given credit without
examination, by which their minds were so strongly prejudiced
against me, that many in the compass of these two
last meetings were not willing to see me, nor hear any
reasons given to show them their mistakes, and that the
reports they had heard were altogether unfounded: however,
I was favored to communicate the truth to those who
attended, so that they generally went away fully satisfied,
and I left them with peace of mind."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_193_193" id="Footnote_193_193"></a><a href="#FNanchor_193_193"><span class="label">[193]</span></a> "Journal," p. 430.</p></div>

<p>In 1829, under date of Seventh month 9th, in a letter
written at Oblong, in Westchester County, New York, he
expresses the feeling that the meeting at Jericho sustains
important relations to the branch of Friends with which he
was connected. The letter was written to his children,
Valentine and Abigail Hicks. In it he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Although absent in body, yet my mind pretty often
takes a sudden and instantaneous excursion to Jericho,
clothed with a desire that we who constitute that monthly
meeting, may keep our eye so single, to the sure and im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span>movable
foundation of the light within, so as to be entirely
preserved from all fleshly reasonings, which if given way
to, in the least degree, ever has, and ever will, have a
tendency to divide in Jacob and scatter in Israel. I consider
that much depends upon the course we take in our
monthly meeting, as we are much looked up to as an
example and if we make but a small miss, it may do much
harm."</p></blockquote>

<p>Twelfth month 15, 1829, Elias Hicks wrote to his
friend Johnson Legg, evidently in reply to one asking advice
in regard to his own conduct in relation to the "separation."
In this letter Elias says: "In the present interrupted and
disturbed state of our once peaceful and favoured Society, it
requires great deliberation and humble waiting on the Lord
for counsel before we move forward on the right hand or
the left. Had this been the case with our brethren of this
yearly meeting who style themselves orthodox, I very much
doubt if there would have been any separation among us.
For although the chief cause thereof is placed to my account,
yet I am confident I have given no just cause for it."</p>

<p>This statement undoubtedly expresses the real feeling
of Elias Hicks regarding the "separation." He could not
see why what he repeatedly called "mere opinions" should
cause a rupture in the Society. It will be noted that he
still refers to the other Friends as "our brethren," and
he, apparently, had no ill-will toward them. The letter from
which this extract was taken was written only about two
months before his death, and was undoubtedly his last written
word on the unfortunate controversy, and the trouble
that grew out of it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="subtitle">Friendly and Unfriendly Critics.</p>


<p>Few men in their day were more talked about than
Elias Hicks. The interest in his person and in his preaching
continued for years after his death. While the discussion
ceased to be warm long years ago, his name is one
which men of so-called liberal thought still love to conjure
with, without very clearly knowing the reason why. Some
clearer light may be thrown upon his life, labor and
character by a brief review of opinions of those who criticised
him as friends, and some of them as partisans, and
those who were his open enemies, for the theological atmosphere
had not yet appeared in which he could be even
approximately understood by the men of the old school.</p>

<p>We shall begin the collection of criticisms by quoting
Edward Hicks,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> who wrote a comparatively judicial estimate
of his friend and kinsman. After stating that even
the apostles had their weak side, that Tertullian "was led
into a foolish extreme by the fanatical notions of Montanus;"
and that Origen "did immense mischief to the
cause of primitive Christianity by his extreme attachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[Pg 203]</span>
to the Platonic philosophy, scholastic divinity and human
learning," he remarks:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_194_194" id="Footnote_194_194"></a><a href="#FNanchor_194_194"><span class="label">[194]</span></a> Edward Hicks, a relative of Elias Hicks, was born in Attleboro,
Pa., Fourth month 4, 1780. His mother passed away when
he was an infant, and he was cared for in his early youth by Elizabeth
Twining, a friend of his mother. When a young man, he became a
member of Middletown Monthly Meeting in Bucks County by request.
He began speaking in meeting when about thirty years of age, and
was a little later recorded as a minister. Edward Hicks for many
years carried on the business of carriage maker and painter at Newtown,
Pa. Although much more orthodox in doctrine than his celebrated
kinsman, he was one of the most ardent friends and defenders of
Elias Hicks.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"Therefore, it is among the possible circumstances
that dear Elias was led to an extreme in the Unitarian
speculation, while opposing the Trinitarian, then increasing
among Friends, and now almost established among
our orthodox Friends. But I have no recollection of ever
hearing him in public testimony, and I have heard him
much, when his speculative views or manner of speaking,
destroyed the savour of life that attended his ministry,
or gave me any uneasiness. But I have certainly heard
to my sorrow, too many of his superficial admirers that
have tried to copy after him, pretending to wear his crown,
without knowing anything of his cross, make use of the
naked term, Jesus, both in public and private, till it sounded
in my ears as unpleasant, as if coming from the tongue of
the profane swearer; and on the other hand, I have been
pained to hear the unnecessary repetition of the terms, our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, from those I verily believed
Elias's bitter enemies, especially the English
preachers, and have scarcely a doubt that they were substantially
breaking the third commandment. And I will
now add my opinion fearlessly, that Elias was wrong in
entering into that quibbling controversy with those weak
Quakers, alluded to in his letter, about the marvellous conception
and parentage of Christ, a delicate and inexplicable
subject, that seems to have escaped the particular attention
of what we call the darker ages, to disgrace the highest
professors of the nineteenth century."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p></blockquote>

92.</p></div>

<p>An independent, and in the main, a judicial critic of
Quakers and Quakerism is Frederick Storrs Turner, an
Englishman. Some of his estimates and observations of
Elias Hicks, are both apt and discriminating. Of his
preaching Turner says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"His great theme was the light within; his one aim
to promote a true living spiritual, practical Christianity.
He was more dogmatic and controversial than Woolman.
There seems to have been in him a revival of the old ag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[Pg 204]</span>gressive
zeal, and something of the acerbity of the early
Quakers. 'Hireling priests' were as offensive in his eyes
as in those of George Fox. He would have no compromise
with the religions of the world, and denounced all new-fangled
methods and arrangements for religious work and
worship in the will of man. He was a Quaker to the backbone,
and stood out manfully for the 'ancient simplicity.'"<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p></blockquote>

Storrs Turner, 1889, p. 292.</p></div>

<p>With still deeper insight Turner continues his analysis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This was his dying testimony: 'The cross of Christ
is the perfect law of God, written in the heart ...
there is but one Lord, one faith, and but one baptism....
No rational being can be a real Christian and true
disciple of Christ until he comes to know all these things
verified in his own experience.' He was a good man, a
true Christian, and a Quaker of the Quakers. His very
errors were the errors of a Quaker, and since the generation
of the personal disciples of George Fox it would be difficult
to point out any man who had a simpler and firmer faith in
the central truth of Quakerism than Elias Hicks."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Regarding some of the bitter criticisms uttered against
Elias Hicks at the time of the controversy in the second
decade of the nineteenth century, and repeated by the biographers
and advocates of some of his opponents, Turner
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This concensus of condemnation by such excellent
Christian men would blast Hicks's character effectually,
were it not for the remembrance that we have heard these
shrieks of pious horror before. Just so did Faldo and Baxter,
Owen and Bunyan, unite in anathematizing George Fox
and the first Quakers. Turning from these invectives of
theological opponents to Hicks's own writings, we at once
discover that this arch-heretic was a simple, humble-minded,
earnest Quaker of the old school."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[Pg 205]</span></p></div>

<p>James Mott, Sr., of Mamaroneck, N. Y., was among
the friendly, although judicial critics of Elias Hicks. In
a letter written Eighth month 5, 1805, to Elias, he said:
"I am satisfied that the master hath conferred on thee a
precious gift in the ministry, and I have often sat with
peculiar satisfaction in hearing thee exercise it." He then
continues, referring to a special occasion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But when thou came to touch on predestination, and
some other erroneous doctrines, I thought a little zeal was
suffered to take place, that led into much censoriousness,
and that expressed in harsh expressions, not only against
the doctrines, but those who had embraced them.... I
have often thought if ministers, when treating on doctrinal
points, or our belief, were to hold up our principles fully
and clearly, and particularly our fundamental principle
of the light within, what it was, and how it operates, there
would very seldom be occasion for declamation against
other tenets, however opposite to our own; nor never
against those who have through education or some other
medium embraced them."</p></blockquote>

<p>This would seem to be as good advice at the beginning
of the twentieth century as it was in the first years
of the nineteenth.</p>

<p>In the matter of estimating Elias Hicks, Walt Whitman
indulged in the following criticism, supplementing an
estimate of his preaching. Dealing with some opinions of
the contemporaries of Elias Hicks, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They think Elias Hicks had a large element of personal
ambition, the pride of leadership, of establishing perhaps
a sect that should reflect his own name, and to which
he should give special form and character. Very likely,
such indeed seems the means all through progress and
civilization, by which strong men and strong convictions
achieve anything definite. But the basic foundation of
Elias was undoubtedly genuine religious fervor. He was
like an old Hebrew prophet. He had the spirit of one, and
in his later years looked like one."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_199_199" id="Footnote_199_199"></a><a href="#FNanchor_199_199"><span class="label">[199]</span></a> "The Complete Works of Walt Whitman," Vol. 3, p. 269-270.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span></p></div>

<p>It is not worth while to deny that Elias Hicks was
ambitious, and desired to secure results in his labor. But
those who carefully go over his recorded words will find
little to warrant the literal conclusion of his critics in this
particular. He probably had no idea at any time of founding
a sect, or perpetuating his name attached to a fragment
of the Society of Friends, either large or small. He believed
that he preached the truth; he wanted men to embrace
it, as it met the divine witness in their own souls, and not
otherwise.</p>

<p>Among the severe critics of Elias Hicks is William
Tallack, who in his book "Thomas Shillitoe," says that
"many of Elias <span class="correction" title="Originally: Hick's">Hicks'</span> assertions are too blasphemous for
quotation," while W. Hodgson, refers to the "filth" of the
sentiments of Elias Hicks. But both these Friends use
words rather loosely. Both must employ their epithets entirely
in a theological, and not a moral sense. Having gone
over a large amount of the published and private utterances
of the Jericho preacher, we have failed to find in them even
an impure suggestion. The bitterness of their attacks,
simply illustrates the bad spirit in which theological discussion
is generally conducted.</p>

<p>The fame of Elias Hicks as a liberalizing influence in
religion seems to have reached the Orient. Under date,
"Calcutta, June 29, 1827," the celebrated East Indian,
Rammohun Roy,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> addressed an appreciative letter to him.
It was sent by a Philadelphian, J. H. Foster, of the ship
Georgian, and contained the following expressions:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_200_200" id="Footnote_200_200"></a><a href="#FNanchor_200_200"><span class="label">[200]</span></a> Rammohun Roy was born in Bengal in 1772, being a high-class
Brahmin. He was highly educated, and at one time in the employ of
the English Government. In comparatively early life he became a
religious and social reformer, and incurred the <span class="correction" title="Originally: emnity">enmity</span> of his family.
He published various works in different languages, including English.
In 1828 he founded a liberal religious association which grew into the
Brahmo Somaj. Roy visited England in 1831, and died there in 1833.</p></div>

<p>A copy of what purports to be a reply to this letter is
in existence, and is probably genuine, as the language is
in accordance with the well-known ideas of Elias Hicks.
Besides, an undated personal letter contains a direct reference
to the East Indian correspondence. From it we quote:
"I take my pen to commune with thee in this way on divers
accounts, and first in regard to a letter I have recently received
from Calcutta, subscribed by Rammohun Roy, author
of a book entitled, 'The Precepts of Jesus, a Guide to Peace
and Happiness.'"<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>A request is made that William Wharton will find
out if the ship-master, Foster, mentioned above, would convey
a letter to Calcutta. Then Elias expresses himself as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I also feel a lively interest in whatever relates to the
welfare and progress of that enlightened and worthy Hindoo,
believing that if he humbly attends to that hath begun
a good work in him, and is faithful to its manifestations that
he will not only witness the blessed effects of it, in his
own preservation and salvation, but will be made an instrument
in the divine hand of much good to his own people,
and nation, by spreading the truth, and opening the right
way of salvation among them, which may no doubt prove
a great and singular blessing not only to the present, but
to succeeding generations. And also be a means of open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span>ing

make a profession of godliness, but deny the power thereof,
especially those blind guides, mere man-made ministers,
and self-styled missionaries, sent out by Bible and missionary
societies of man's constituting, under the pretence of
converting those, who in the pride of their hearts they call
Heathen, to Christianity, while at the same time, judging
them by their fruits they themselves, or most of them,
stand in as great, or greater need, of right conversion."</p></blockquote>

<p>Among the present-day critics of Elias Hicks, is Dr. J.
Rendell Harris, of England. In his paper at the Manchester
Conference in 1895, this quotation from Elias Hicks
is given: "God never made any distinction in the manifestation
of his love to his rational creatures. He has
placed every son and daughter of Adam on the same ground
and in the same condition that our first parents were in.
For every child must come clean out of the hands of God."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
Doctor Harris says Elias Hicks "was wrong not simply because
he was unscriptural, but because he was unscientific."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
Doctor Harris prefaces this remark by the following
comment on the quotation from Elias Hicks: "Now
suppose such a doctrine to be propounded in this conference
would not the proper answer, the answer of any modern
thinker, be (1) that we never had any first parents; (2)
we were demonstrably not born good."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> We do not at all
assume that Elias Hicks had no limitations, or that he was
correct at all points in his thinking, measured by the standards
of present-day knowledge or any other standard. But
we must claim that in holding that we had first parents, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>
was scriptural. The poor man, however, seems to have
been, unconsciously, of course, between two stools. The
orthodox Friends in the early part of the nineteenth century
claimed that Elias was unsound because he did not cling
to the letter of the scripture, and his critic just quoted claims
that he was unscientific although he used a scriptural term.
Doctor Harris then concludes that "a little knowledge of
evolution would have saved him (Hicks) all that false doctrine."
But how, in his time, could he have had any knowledge
of evolution? A man can hardly be criticised for not
possessing knowledge absolutely unavailable in his day and
generation. We are then informed "that the world at any
given instant, shows almost every stage of evolution of life,
from the am&oelig;ba to the man, and from the cannibal to the
saint. Shall we say that the love of God is equally manifested
in all these?"<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> To use the Yankee answer by asking
another question, may we inquire, in all seriousness, who
is qualified to say with certainty that it is not so manifested?

<p>Elias Hicks was given to using figures of speech and
scriptural illustrations in a broad sense, and those who carefully
read his utterances will have no trouble in seeing in
the quotation used by Doctor Harris simply an attempt to
repudiate the attribute of favoritism on the part of the
Heavenly Father toward any of his human children, and
not to formulate a new philosophy of life, based on a theory
of the universe about which he had never heard.</p>

<p>The special labor of Elias Hicks, as we may now dispassionately
review it, was not as an expounder of doctrine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[Pg 210]</span>
or the creator of a new dogmatism, but as a rationalizing,
liberalizing influence in the field of religion. He was a
pioneer of the "modern thinkers" of whom Doctor Harris
speaks, and did much, amid misunderstanding and the
traducing of men, to prepare the way for the broader
intellectual and spiritual liberty we now enjoy.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Recollections, Reminiscences and Testimonies.</p>


<p>Many statements which have come down to us from
the generation in which Elias Hicks lived, warrant the conclusion
that he was a natural orator. He possessed in a
large degree what the late Bishop Simpson, of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, called "heart power." We are able to
give the personal impression of a venerable Friend<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> now
living, who as a boy of eleven heard Elias preach twice.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_206_206" id="Footnote_206_206"></a><a href="#FNanchor_206_206"><span class="label">[206]</span></a> Dr. Jesse C. Green, of West Chester, Pa., now in his 93d year.
Doctor Green almost retains the sprightliness of youth.</p></div>

<p>One of the sermons was delivered at Center, Del., on
the 8th of Twelfth month, 1828, and the other the day before
at West Chester. This was on his last long religious
visit, which took him to the then "far west," Ohio and
Indiana.</p>

<p>Doctor Green says that the manner of Elias Hicks when
speaking was very impressive. In person he is described
by this Friend "as above medium height, rather slim, and
with a carriage that would attract universal attention." He
wore very plain clothes of a drab color.</p>

<p>With no education in logic, and no disposition to indulge
in forensic debate, he was, nevertheless a logician,
and had he indulged in public disputation, would have made
it interesting if not uncomfortable for his adversary.</p>

<p>If he occasionally became involved, or got into verbal
deep water, he always extricated himself, and made his
position clear to his hearers. Doctor Green tells us that
he had an uncle, not a member of meeting, but a good judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span>
of public speaking, who considered Elias Hicks the most
logical preacher in the Society of Friends. On one occasion
he heard Elias when he became very much involved
in his speaking, and as this person put it, he thought Elias
had "wound himself up," but in a few minutes he came
down from his verbal flight, and made every point so clear
that he was understood by every listener.</p>

<p>Henry Byran Binns, Whitman's English biographer,
gives the following estimate of the preaching of Elias
Hicks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With grave emphasis he pronounced his text: 'What
is the chief end of man?' and with fiery and eloquent eyes,
in a strong, vibrating, and still musical voice, he commenced
to deliver his soul-awakening message. The fire of his
fervor kindled as he spoke of the purpose of human life;
his broad-brim was dashed from his forehead on to one of
the seats behind him. With the power of intense conviction
his whole presence became an overwhelming persuasion,
melting those who sat before him into tears and
into one heart of wonder and humility under his high and
simple words."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We have another living witness who remembers Elias
Hicks. This Friend says that she, with the members of
her family, were constant attenders of the Jericho meeting.
Speaking of Elias she remarks: "His commanding figure
in the gallery is a bright picture I often see in my mind.
His person was tall, straight and firm; his manner dignified
and noble and agreeable; his voice clear, distinct and penetrating&mdash;altogether
grand."<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

Ninth month 7, 1910. This Friend is 92 years old. The letter received
was entirely written by her, and is a model of legible penmanship and
clear statement.</p></div>

<p>We quote the following interesting incidents from the
letter of Mary Willis:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span></p><blockquote>

<p>"One other bit I recall was a talk, or sermon, to the
young especially. He related that once he threw a stone
and killed a bird, and was struck with consternation and
regret at killing an innocent bird that might be a parent,
and its young perish for the need of care. He appealed
feelingly to the boys to refrain from giving needless pain.</p>

<p>"He was guardian to my mother, sisters and brother,
and they and their mother returned his loving care with
warm affection, always, as did my father.</p>

<p>"One of his characteristics was his kindness to the
poor. Not far from his home (three miles, perhaps) was a
small colony of colored people on poor land, who shared his
bounty in cold, wintry weather, in his wagon loads of
vegetables and wood, delivered by his own hand."</p></blockquote>

<p>Probably one of the most appreciative, and in the main
discriminative estimates of Elias Hicks, was made by Walt
Whitman. The "notes (such as they are) founded on Elias
Hicks," for such the author called them, were written in
Camden, N. J., in the summer of 1888. Elias Hicks had
been dead nearly half a century. Whitman's impressions of
the famous preacher were based on the memory of a
boy ten years old, for that was Whitman's age when he
heard Elias Hicks preach in Brooklyn. But personal memory
was supplemented by the statements of his parents,
especially his mother, as the preaching of their old Long
Island neighbor was undoubtedly a subject of frequent conversation
in the Whitman home.</p>

<p>As to the manner of the preacher Whitman says:
"While he goes on he falls into the nasality and sing-song
tone sometimes heard in such meetings; but in a moment
or two, more as if recollecting himself, he breaks off, stops,
and resumes in a natural tone. This occurs three or four
times during the talk of the evening, till he concludes."<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>The "unnamable something behind oratory," Whitman
says Elias Hicks had, and it "emanated from his very heart
to the heart of his audience, or carried with him, or probed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span>
into, and shook or aroused in them a sympathetic germ."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>There are a good many anecdotes regarding Elias Hicks
current in Jericho, going to show some of his characteristics.
It is stated that at one time he found that corn was
being taken, evidently through the slats of the crib. One
night he set a trap in the suspected place. Going to the
barn in the morning he saw a man standing near where the
trap was set. Elias passed on without seeming to notice the
visitor. On returning to the house he stopped, spoke to the
man, and released him from the trap. Elias would never
tell who the man was.</p>

<p>Illustrating his feeling regarding slavery, and his testimony
against slave labor, the following statement is made:
Before his death, and following the fatal paralytic stroke,
he noticed that the quilt with which he was covered contained
cotton. He had lost the power of speech, but he
pushed the covering off, thus indicating his displeasure at
the presence of an article of comfort which was the product
of slave labor.</p>

<p>There is an anecdote which illustrates the spirit of the
man in a striking way. He is said to have had a neighbor
with whom it did not seem possible to maintain cordial
relations. One day Elias saw this neighbor with a big
load of hay stalled in a marsh in one of his fields. Without
a word of recognition Elias approached the man in the
slough and hitching his own ox team to the load in front
of the other team proceeded to pull the load out of the
slough. It was all done in characteristic Quaker silence.
The result was the establishment of cordial relations between
the two neighbors.</p>

<p>In bestowing his benefactions, he was exceedingly sensitive,
not wishing to be known in the matter, and especially
not desiring to receive ordinary expressions of gratitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>
His habitual custom was to take his load of wood or provisions,
as the case might be, leave them at the door or in
the yard of the family in need, and without announcement
or comment silently steal away.</p>

<p>During the Revolutionary War, Elias Hicks, in common
with other Friends, had property seized in lieu of military
service or taxes. The value does not seem to have been
great in any of the cases which were reported to the monthly
meeting. We copy the following cases from the records:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the 28th of Eighth month, 1777, came Justice Maloon,
Robert Wilson, Daniel Wilson, and Daniel Weeks,
sergeant under the above Captain (Youngs) and took from
me a pair of silver buckles, worth 18 shillings; two pair of
stockings worth 15 shillings; and two handkerchiefs worth
5 shillings, for my not going at the time of an alarm.&mdash;Elias
Hicks, Jericho, 24th of Ninth month, 1777."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

Sufferings, etc.," p. 231.</p></div>

<p>The "silver buckles" were either for the shoes or the
knees. They were evidently more ornamental than useful,
and how they comported with the owner's rather severe
ideas of plainness is not for us to explain. The price put
on these stockings may surprise some twentieth century
reader, but it should be remembered that they were long to
reach to the knees, and went with short breeches called in
the vernacular of the time, "small clothes."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The 3d of Twelfth month, 1777, there came to my
house George Weeks, sergeant under said Captain (Thorne)
with a warrant, and demanded twelve shillings of me toward
paying some men held to repair the forts near the
west end of the island, and upon my refusing to pay, took
from me a great coat, worth one pound and six shillings.&mdash;Elias
Hicks."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We continue the "sufferings," only remarking that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>
"great coat" was an overcoat, the price at the equivalent of
about six dollars and a half was not overdrawn.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Sixth month, 1778, taken from Elias Hicks by
order of Captain Daniel Youngs, for refusing to pay toward
hiring of men to work on fortifications near Brooklyn
Ferry, a pair of stockings worth 5 shillings; razor case and
two razors, worth 4 shillings."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The next record of "suffering" is more than ordinarily
interesting in that it shows that the seizures of property
were very arbitrary, and it also gives the price of wheat on
Long Island at that time. We quote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"About the middle of Tenth month, 1779, came George
Weeks, by order of Captain Daniel Youngs, and I being
from home demanded from my wife three pounds, for not
assisting to build a fort at Brooklyn Ferry, for which he
took two bags with three bushels of wheat, worth one
pound, ten shillings."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_214_214" id="Footnote_214_214"></a><a href="#FNanchor_214_214"><span class="label">[214]</span></a> The same, p. 254.</p></div>

<p>At this rate the market price of wheat was $2.50 per
bushel. Possibly this was during the period of scarcity,
referred to in the introduction.</p>

<p>In 1794 Elias Hicks was influential in establishing in
Jericho an organization, the scope of which was described in
its preamble as follows: "We, the subscribers, do hereby
associate and unite into a Society of Charity for the relief
of poor among the black people, more especially for the
education of their children."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_215_215" id="Footnote_215_215"></a><a href="#FNanchor_215_215"><span class="label">[215]</span></a> This organization has been in continuous existence since its
inception. Meets regularly every year, and distributes the proceeds of
an invested fund in accordance with its original purpose.</p></div>

<p>This society was almost revolutionary at the time of
its inception, showing how far-seeing its projectors were.
Its constitution declared that the society was rendered nec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>essary
because of the injustice and lack of opportunity
which the colored people suffered. The hope was expressed
that the time would come when the black people would
cease to be a submerged and oppressed race. It was provided
that in case the original need for the society should
disappear, its benefits might be distributed in any helpful
way. It may be interesting to note that at the meetings of
the society the scarcity of colored children attending the
school was mentioned with regret. So far as we know, the
Jericho society was the first organized Friendly effort in
negro education. Elias Hicks contributed $50 to the invested
funds of the organization.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Putting Off the Harness.</p>


<p>During the series of visits, reported in the twenty-second
chapter, Elias was ill a number of times, and was
forced to rest from his labors. On the return trip from
central and western New York, he visited for the last
time the Hudson Valley meetings which he attended on
his first religious journey in 1779.</p>

<p>He arrived in New York the 8th of Eleventh month,
attending the mid-week meeting at Hester Street that day.
On First-day, the 15th, he attended the Rose Street meeting
in the morning and Hester Street in the afternoon.
Second-day evening, the 16th, a largely attended appointed
meeting was held in Brooklyn. He then proceeded toward
Jericho, arriving home on Fourth-day, the 18th of Eleventh
month, 1829.</p>

<p>The "Journal" is singularly silent regarding this
Brooklyn meeting. Henry Byran Binns, on what he considers
good authority, says, "Elias Hicks preached in the
ball-room of Morrison's Hotel on Brooklyn Heights." To
this statement he has added this bit of realistic description:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The scene was one he (Whitman) never forgot. The
finely fitted and fashionable place of dancing, the officers
and gay ladies in that mixed and crowded assembly, the
lights, the colors and all the associations, both of the faces
and of the place, presenting so singular contrast with the
plain ancient Friends seated upon the platform, their broad-brims
on their heads, their eyes closed; with silence,
long continued and becoming oppressive; and most of
all, with the tall, prophetic figure that rose at length to
break it."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span></p></div>

<p>Whitman's own reference to this meeting is still more
striking. He says that he, a boy of ten, was allowed to
go to the Hicks meeting because he "had been behaving well
that day." The "principal dignitaries of the town" attended
this meeting, while uniformed officers from the
United States Navy Yard graced the gathering with their
presence. The text was, "What is the chief end of man?"
Whitman says: "I cannot follow the discourse, it presently
becomes very fervid and in the midst of its fervor, he takes
the broad-brim hat from his head and almost dashing it
down with violence on the seat behind, continues with uninterrupted
earnestness. Though the differences and disputes
of the formal division of the Society of Friends were
even then under way, he did not allude to them at all. A
pleading, tender, nearly agonizing conviction and magnetic
stream of natural eloquence, before which all minds
and natures, all emotions, high or low, gentle or simple,
yielded entirely without exception, was its cause, method
and effect. Many, very many, were in tears."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>With the account of this journey of 1829 his narrative
in the "Journal" closed. This paragraph formed a fitting
benediction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The foregoing meetings were times of favor, and as a
seal from the hand of our gracious and never-failing helper,
to the labor and travail which he has led me into, and
enabled me to perform, for the promotion of this great and
noble cause of truth and righteousness in the earth, as set
forth in the foregoing account, and not suffering any
weapon formed against me to prosper. 'This is the heritage
of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness
is of me, saith the Lord.' For all these unmerited favors
and mercies, in deep humiliation my soul doth magnify the
Lord, and return thanksgiving and glory to his great and
excellent name; for his mercy endureth forever."<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span></p></div>

<p>It should be remembered that Elias Hicks was then
past his eighty-first year. He started on this last long
religious visit, Sixth month 24th, and was therefore absent
from home one week less than five months. He says himself,
in the last sentence of the "Journal": "We traveled
in this journey nearly fifteen hundred miles." These are
words as impressive as they are simple.</p>

<p>During this trip many families were visited from the
Valley of the Genesee to the City of New York, where
he tarried several days that he might see his friends in
their homes. Whatever may have been their mind in the
case, he doubtless felt that they would look upon his face
no more.</p>

<p>But Elias Hicks was not yet free from his religious
concerns, for on First month 21, 1830, he asked for a
minute, which was granted by Jericho Monthly Meeting,
and is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our beloved Friend, Elias Hicks, presented a concern
to make a religious visit to the families of Friends
and some Friendly people (as way may open), within the
compass of this and Westbury Monthly Meeting, which
claimed the solid attention of this meeting, was united
with, and he left at liberty to pursue his prospect accordingly."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the last minute ever asked for by Elias Hicks.
But evidently the visits contemplated were never undertaken,
for about that time he had a slight attack of paralysis,
which affected his right side and arm. Still the next
day he attended a meeting at Bethpage, and a little later
quarterly and monthly meetings in New York. In both he
performed ministerial service with his usual power and
clearness. From a little brochure printed in 1829, we
quote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the Monthly Meeting, he took a review of his labors
in the city for many years; and then expressed a belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span>
that his religious services were brought nearly to a close.</p>

<p>"After adverting to the great deviations that had taken
place in the Society, from that plainness and simplicity
into which our principles would lead us, he added, 'but if
I should live two or three years longer, what a comfort it
would be to me to see a reformation in these respects.'
He then spoke in commemoration of the goodness of his
Heavenly Father, and closed with these memorable words:
'As certainly as we are engaged to glorify him in all our
works, he will as certainly glorify us.'"<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p></blockquote>

J. Richards, printer, 130 North Third Street.</p></div>

<p>But the time of putting off the harness was near at
hand. On the 14th of Second month, 1830, he suffered
a severe attack of paralysis which involved the entire right
side, and deprived him of the use of his voice. When
attacked he was alone in his room, but succeeded in getting
to his family in an adjoining apartment. He declined all
medical aid. In a condition of helplessness he lingered
until Seventh-day the 27th, when he quietly passed away.
Although he could only communicate by signs, consciousness
remained until near the end.</p>

<p>The funeral was held in the meeting house at Jericho,
on Fourth-day, Third month 3d. Without a storm raged
in strange contrast to the peace and quiet within. A large
company braved the elements, to pay their respects to his
worth, as a man and a minister, while a number of visiting
ministering Friends had sympathetic service at the funeral,
after which the burial took place in the ground adjoining
the meeting-house, where he had long worshipped and
ministered.</p>

<p>The last act performed by Elias Hicks before the
fatal stroke came, was to write a letter to his friend Hugh
Judge,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> of Barnesville, Ohio. Between the two men a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
singular sympathy had long existed, and to Hugh, Elias
unburdened his spirit in this last word to the world. In
fact the letter fell from the hand of the writer, after the
shock. It was all complete with signature and postscript.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_220_220" id="Footnote_220_220"></a><a href="#FNanchor_220_220"><span class="label">[220]</span></a> Hugh Judge was born about 1750 of Catholic parents. Joined
Friends in his young manhood in Philadelphia. Removed to Ohio in
1815. Died Twelfth month 21, 1834. He died while on a religious
visit to Friends in Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. Was buried at Kennett
Square. He was a recorded minister for many years.</p></div>

<p>This letter really summarizes the doctrine, and states
the practical religion which inspired the ministry and
determined the life and conduct of this worthy Friend. It
may be well, with its suggestive postscript, to close this
record of the life and labors of Elias Hicks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Jericho, Second month 14th, 1830.<br />
</p>

<p>"Dear Hugh: Thy very acceptable letter of the 21st
ultimo was duly received, and read with interest, tending
to excite renewed sympathetic and mutual fellow-feeling;
and brought to my remembrance the cheering salutation
of the blessed Jesus, our holy and perfect pattern and example,
to his disciples, viz: 'Be of good cheer, I have
overcome the world.' By which he assured his disciples,
that, by walking in the same pathway of self-denial and
the cross, which he trod to blessedness, they might also
overcome the world; as nothing has ever enabled any
rational being, in any age of the world, to overcome the
spirit of the world, which lieth in wickedness, but the
cross of Christ.</p>

<p>"Some may query, what is the cross of Christ? To
these I answer, it is the perfect law of God, written on
the tablet of the heart, and in the heart of every rational
creature, in such indelible characters that all the power of
mortals cannot erase nor obliterate. Neither is there any
power or means given or dispensed to the children of men,
but this inward law and light, by which the true and saving
knowledge of God can be obtained. And by this inward
law and light, all will be either justified or condemned, and
all be made to know God for themselves, and be left without
excuse; agreeably to the prophecy of Jeremiah, and the
corroborating testimony of Jesus in his last counsel and
command to his disciples, not to depart from Jerusalem
until they should receive power from on high; assuring
them that they should receive power when they had re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>ceived
the pouring forth of the spirit upon them, which
would qualify them to bear witness to him in Judea,
Jerusalem, Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth;
which was verified in a marvellous manner on the day of
Pentecost, when thousands were converted to the Christian
faith in one day. By which it is evident that nothing but
this inward light and law, as it is heeded and obeyed, ever
did, or ever can make a true and real Christian and child of
God. And until the professors of Christianity agree to lay
aside all their non-essentials in religion, and rally to this
unchangeable foundation and standard of truth, wars and
fightings, confusion and error will prevail, and the angelic
song cannot be heard in our land, that of 'glory to God in
the highest, and on earth peace and good will to men.' But
when all nations are made willing to make this inward law
and light the rule and standard of all their faith and works,
then we shall be brought to know and believe alike, that
there is but one Lord, one faith, and but one baptism; one
God and Father, that is above all, through all, and in all;
and then will all those glorious and consoling prophecies,
recorded in the scriptures of truth, be fulfilled. Isaiah 2:4.
'He,' the Lord, 'shall judge among the nations, and rebuke
many people; and they shall beat their swords into plough-shares,
and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall
not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn
war any more.' Isaiah 11. 'The wolf also shall dwell with
the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and
the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together; and
a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear
shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and
the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child
shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child put
his hand on the cockatrice's den. They shall not hurt nor
destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth,' that is
our earthly tabernacles, 'shall be full of the knowledge of
the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.'</p>

<p>"These scripture testimonies give a true and correct
description of the gospel state, and no rational being can be
a real Christian and true disciple of Christ until he comes
to know all these things verified in his own experience, as
every man and woman has more or less of all those different
animal propensities and passions in their nature; and they
predominate and bear rule, and are the source and fountain
from whence all wars, and every evil work, proceed, and
will continue as long as man remains in his first nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>
and is governed by his animal spirit and propensities, which
constitute the natural man, which Paul tells us, 'receiveth
not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness
unto him, neither can he know them, because they are
spiritually discerned.' This corroborates the declaration
of Jesus to Nicodemus, that 'except a man be born again he
cannot see the kingdom of God;' for 'that which is born
of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is
spirit.'</p>

<p>"Here Jesus assures us, beyond all doubt, that nothing
but spirit can either see or enter into the kingdom of God;
and this confirms Paul's doctrine, that 'as many as are led
by the spirit of God are the sons of God, and joint heirs
with Christ.' And Jesus assures us, by his declaration to
his <span class="correction" title="Originally: diciples">disciples</span>, John 14:16-17; 'if ye love me keep my commandments;
and I will pray the Father and he shall give
you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever,
even the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive;'
that is, men and women in their natural state, who have
not given up to be led by this spirit of truth, that leads and
guides into all truth; 'because they see him not, neither do
they know him, but ye know him, for he dwelleth with
you, and shall be in you.' And as these give up to be
wholly led and guided by him, the new birth is brought
forth in them, and they witness the truth of another testimony
of Paul's, even that of being 'created anew in Christ
Jesus unto good works,' which God had foreordained that
all his new-born children should walk in them, and thereby
show forth, by their fruits and good works, that they were
truly the children of God, born of his spirit, and taught
of him; agreeably to the testimony of the prophet, that
'the children of the Lord are all taught of the Lord, and in
righteousness they are established, and great is the peace
of his children.' And nothing can make them afraid that
man can do unto them; as saith the prophet in his appeal
to Jehovah: 'Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose
mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee.' Therefore
let every one that loves the truth, for God is truth,
'trust in the Lord forever, for in the Lord Jehovah there
is everlasting strength.'</p>

<p>"I write these things to thee, not as though thou didst
not know them, but as a witness to thy experience, as 'two
are better than one, and a threefold cord is not quickly
broken.'</p>

<p>"I will now draw to a close, with just adding, for thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
encouragement, be of good cheer, for no new thing has
happened to us; for it has ever been the lot of the righteous
to pass through many trials and tribulations in their passage
to that glorious, everlasting peace and happy abode, where
all sorrow and sighing come to an end; the value of which
is above all price, for when we have given all that we have,
and can give, and suffered all that we can suffer, it is still
infinitely below its real value. And if we are favored to
gain an inheritance in that blissful and peaceful abode,
'where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are
at rest,' we must ascribe it all to the unmerited mercy and
loving kindness of our Heavenly Father, who remains to
be God over all, blessed forever!</p>

<p>"I will now conclude, and in the fulness of brotherly
love to thee and thine, in which my family unite, subscribe
thy affectionate friend,</p>

<p>"Thy very acceptable letter of the 29th ultimo came duly
to hand, and I have taken my pen not only to acknowledge thy
kindness, but also to state to thee the unfriendly and unchristian
conduct of Anna Braithwaite toward me, not only as
relates to that extract, but in her conversation among Friends
and others, traducing my religious character, and saying I
held and promulgated infidel doctrines, etc.&mdash;endeavoring to
prejudice the minds of Friends against me, behind my back,
in open violation of gospel order. She came to my house, as
stated in the extract thou sent me, after the quarterly meeting
of ministers and elders at Westbury in First month last. At
that meeting was the first time I saw her, which was about
five or six months after her arrival in New York. And as I
had heard her well spoken of as a minister, I could have had
no preconceived opinion of her but what was favorable, therefore,
I treated her with all the cordiality and friendship I was
capable of. She also, from all outward appearance, manifested
the same; and, after dinner, she requested, in company
with A. S., a female Friend that was with her, a private
opportunity with me. So we withdrew into another room,
where we continued in conversation for nearly two hours.
And being innocent and ignorant of any cause that I had
given, on my part, for the necessity of such an opportunity, I
concluded she had nothing more in view than to have a little
free conversation on the state of those select meetings.</p>

<p>"But, to my surprise, the first subject she spoke upon,
was to call in question a sentiment I had expressed in the
meeting aforesaid, which appeared to me to be so plain and
simple, that I concluded the weakest member in our society,
endued with a rational understanding, would have seen the
propriety of. It was a remark I made on the absence of three
out of four of the representatives appointed by one of the
preparative meetings to attend the quarterly meeting. And I
having long been of the opinion, that much weakness had been
introduced into our society by injudicious appointments, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span>
have often been concerned to caution Friends on that account.
The remark I made was this: that I thought there was something
wrong in the present instance&mdash;for, as we profess to
believe in the guidance of the Spirit of Truth as an unerring
Spirit, was it not reasonable to expect, especially in a meeting
of ministers and elders, that if each Friend attended to their
proper gifts, as this Spirit is endued with prescience, that it
would be much more likely, under its divine influence, we
should be led to appoint such as would attend on particular
and necessary occasion, than to appoint those who would not
attend?</p>

<p>"This idea, she contended, was not correct; and the sentiments
she expressed on this subject really affected me. To
think that any, professing to be a gospel minister, called from
a distant land to teach others, and to be so deficient in knowledge
and experience, in so plain a case, that I could not well
help saying to her, that her views were the result of a want
of religious experience, and that I believed if she improved
her talent faithfully, she would be brought to see better, and
acknowledge the correctness of my position. But she replied,
she did not want to see better. This manifestation of her self-importance,
lowered her character, as a gospel minister, very
much in my view; and her subsequent conduct, while she was
with us, abundantly corroborated and confirmed this view concerning
her. As to her charge against me, in regard to the
Scriptures, it is generally incorrect, and some of it false. And
it is very extraordinary, that she should manifest so much
seeming friendship for me, when present, and in my absence
speak against me in such an unbecoming manner. Indeed,
her conduct toward me, often reminds me of the treachery of
Judas, when he betrayed his Master with a kiss. And, instead
of acting toward me as a friend or a Christian, she had been
watching for evil.</p>

<p>"As to my asserting that I believe the Scriptures were
held in too high estimation by the professors of Christianity
in general, I readily admit, as I have asserted it in my public
communications for more than forty years, but, generally, in
opposition to those that held them to be the only rule of faith
and practice; and my views have always been in accordance
with our primitive Friends on this point. And at divers times,
when in conversation with hireling teachers, (and at other
times) I have given it as my opinion, that so long as they
held the Scriptures to be the only rule of faith and practice,
and by which they justify wars, hireling ministry, predestination,
and what they call the ordinances, viz: water baptism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span>
and the passover supper, mere relics of the Jewish law, so long
the Scriptures did such, more harm than good; but that the
fault was not in the Scriptures, but in their literal and carnal
interpretation of them&mdash;and that would always be the case
until they came to the Spirit that gave them forth, as no other
power could break the seal, and open them rightly to us.
Hence I have observed, in my public communications, and in
conversation with the members of different denominations, and
others, who held that the Scriptures are the primary and only
rule of faith and practice&mdash;that, according to the true analogy
of reasoning, 'that for which a thing is such&mdash;the thing itself is
more such'&mdash;as the Spirit was before the Scriptures, and above
them, and without the Spirit they could not have been written
or known. And with this simple but conclusive argument, I
have convinced divers of the soundness of our doctrine in this
respect&mdash;that not the Scriptures but the Spirit of Truth, which
Jesus commanded his disciples to wait for, as their only rule,
they would teach them all things, and guide them into all truth,
is the primary and only rule of faith and practice, and is the
only means by which our salvation is effected.</p>

<p>"The extract contains so much inconsistency, and is so
incorrect, that, as I proceed, it appears less and less worthy
of a reply, and yet it does contain some truth. I admit that
I did assert, and have long done it, that we cannot believe
what we do not understand. This the Scripture affirms, Deut.
xxix. 29&mdash;'The secret things belong unto the Lord our God,
but the things that are revealed belong unto us and our children
forever, that we may do all the words of this law'&mdash;and
all that is not revealed, is to us the same as a nonentity, and
will forever remain so, until it is revealed; and that which is
revealed, enables us, agreeably to the apostle's exhortation, to
give a reason of the hope that is in us, to honest inquirers. I
also assert, that we ought to bring all doctrines, whether written
or verbal, to the test of the Spirit of Truth in our minds, as
the only sure director relative to the things of God; otherwise,
why is a manifestation of the Spirit given to every man if <span class="correction" title="Originally: it it">it</span>
not to profit by; and, if the Scriptures are about the Spirit,
and a more certain test of doctrines, why is the Spirit given,
seeing it is useless? But this doctrine, that the Scriptures are
the only rule of faith and practice, is a fundamental error, and
is manifested to be so by the Scriptures themselves, and also
by our primitive Friends' writings. It would seem that Anna
Braithwaite has strained every nerve in exaggerating my
words, for I have not said more than R. Barclay, and many
others of our predecessors, respecting the errors in our English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span>
translation of the Bible. Hence it appears, that she was determined
to criminate me at all events, by striving to make me
erroneous for saying that the Gospel handed to us, was no
more authentic than many other writings. Surely a person that
did not assent to this, must be ignorant indeed.</p>

<p>"Are not the writings of our primitive Friends as
authentic as any book or writing, and especially such as were
written so many centuries ago, the originals of which have
been lost many hundred years? And are not the histories of
passing events, written by candid men of the present age,
which thousands know to be true, as authentic as the Bible?</p>

<p>"Her assertions, that I asked if she could be so ignorant
as to believe in the account of the creation of the world, and
that I had been convinced for the last ten years, that it was
only an allegory, and that it had been especially revealed to
me at a meeting in Liberty Street about that time; that I asked
her if she thought Adam was any worse after he had eaten
the forbidden fruit than before, and that I said I did
not believe he was; and also her asserting, that I said that
Jesus Christ was no more than a prophet, and that I further
said, that if she would read the Scriptures attentively she
would believe that Jesus was the son of Joseph: these assertions
of hers, are all false and unfounded, and must be the result
of a feigned or forced construction of something I might
have said, to suit her own purpose. For those who do not
wish to be satisfied with fair reasoning, there is no end to their
cavilling and misrepresentation. As to what she relates as it
regards the manner of our coming into the world in our infant
state, it is my belief, that we come into the world in the
same state of innocence, and endowed with the same propensities
and desires that our first parents were, in their primeval
state; and this Jesus Christ has established, and must be conclusive
in the minds of all true believers; when he took a little
child in his arms and blessed him, and said to them around
him that except they were converted, and become as that
little child, they should in no case enter into the kingdom of
heaven. Of course, all the desires and propensities of that
little child, and of our first parents in their primeval state,
must have been good, as they were all the endowments of their
Creator, and given to them for a special purpose. But it is
the improper and unlawful indulgence of them that is evil.</p>

<p>"I readily acknowledge, I have not been able to see or
understand, how the cruel persecution and crucifixion of Jesus
Christ, by the wicked and hard-hearted Jews, should expiate
my sins; and never have known anything to effect that for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span>
me, but the grace of God, that taught me, agreeably to the
apostle's doctrine, to deny all ungodliness and the world's
lusts, and do live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present
world; and as I have faithfully abode under its teachings, in
full obedience thereto, I have been brought to believe that my
sins were forgiven, and I permitted to sit under the Lord's
teaching, as saith the prophet: 'that the children of the Lord
are all taught of the Lord, and in righteousness they are established,
and great is the peace of his children.' And so long as
I feel this peace, there is nothing in this world that makes me
afraid, as it respects my eternal condition. But if any of my
friends have received and known benefit from any outward
sacrifice, I do not envy them their privilege. But, surely, they
would not be willing that I should acknowledge as a truth, that
which I have no kind of knowledge of. I am willing to admit,
that Divine Mercy is no doubt watching over his rational
creation for their good, and may secretly work at times for
their preservation; but, if, in his infinite wisdom and goodness,
he sees meet to hide it from us, as most consistent with
his wisdom and our good, let us have a care that we do not,
in the pride of our hearts, undertake to <span class="correction" title="Originally: prey">pry</span> into his secret
counsels, lest we offend; but be content with what he is pleased
to reveal to us, let it be more or less, and, especially, if he is
pleased to speak peace to our minds. And when he graciously
condescends to do this, we shall know it to be a peace that
the world cannot give, with all its enjoyments, neither take
away, with all its frowns.</p>

<p>"I shall now draw to a close, and, with the salutation of
gospel love, I subscribe myself thy affectionate and sympathizing
friend and brother.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Portraits.</p>

<p>The cut facing page <a href="#i121">121</a> is a photograph from the painting
by Henry Ketcham. This was sketched by the artist who was
in the public gallery of the meeting house at different times
when Elias Hicks was preaching, his presence being unknown
to the preacher. It was originally a full-length portrait, but
many years ago was injured by fire, when it was cut down
to bust size. For some time it was in the home of the late
Elwood Walter, of Englewood, N. J. For many years it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[Pg 234]</span>
been in the family of Henry B. Seaman. It is believed that
the pictures made under direction of the late Edward Hopper,
had this portrait as their original. The engravings in the
"History of Long Island" and in the "Complete Works of
Walt Whitman," are probably based on this portrait. They
have passed through such a "sleeking-up" process, however,
as to lack the individuality of the more crude production.</p>

<p>The <a href="#FRONTISPIECE">frontispiece</a> is from a photograph of the bust of
Elias Hicks, by the sculptor, William Ordway Partridge, and
was made for Henry B. Seaman. In making the bust the artist
used the oil painting referred to above, and all of the other
pictures of Elias Hicks in existence, including the full-length
silhouette. He also had the bust, said to have been taken
from the death mask, and from them all attempted to construct
what may be termed the "ideal" Elias Hicks.</p>


<h3><a name="APPENDIX_D" id="APPENDIX_D"></a>D</h3>

<p class="subtitle">The Death Mask.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the death mask of Elias
Hicks, from which the bust in Swarthmore College, in the
New York Friend's Library and other places was made.
That such a mask was taken admits of no doubt, and the
only clear statement regarding the matter is given below.
The bust is in the possession of Harry B. Seaman. The
issue of "Niles Register" referred to was published only
six weeks after the death of Elias Hicks.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We understand an Italian artist of this city, has secretly
disinterred the body of Elias Hicks, the celebrated Quaker
preacher, and moulded his bust. It seems he had applied to the
friends of the deceased to take a moulding previous to his interment,
but was refused. Suspicion being excited that the
grave had been disturbed, it was examined, and some bits of
plaster were found adhering to the hair of the deceased. The
enthusiastic Italian was visited, and owned that, as he had been
denied the privilege of taking a bust before interment, he had
adopted the only method of obtaining one. We have heard
nothing more on the subject, except that the bust is a most
excellent likeness."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>"Arrived in this city on the 7th inst., Elias Hicks, a distinguished
minister of the gospel, the Benign Doctrines of
which he is a faithful embassador, has for many years past
practically endeavored (both by precept and example) to promulgate
in its primeval beauty and simplicity, without money
and without price. Those who are Friends to plain truth
and evangelical preaching, that have heretofore been edified
and comforted under his ministry, will doubtless be pleased
to learn of his arrival, and avail themselves of the present

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
